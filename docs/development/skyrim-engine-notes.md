# Skyrim SE/AE engine notes (from the decompiled binary)

Findings from the Ghidra database of `SkyrimSE.exe` 1.6.1170 (AE), gathered while building Drawcall Limit
Fix. Addresses are AE runtime addresses with image base `0x140000000`. Address Library IDs are given as
`SE/AE` where known. Decompiled names such as `FUN_…` and `DAT_…` are Ghidra's; the meanings given are
inferred and should be re-checked before being relied on elsewhere.

## Lighting shader: from property flags to shader descriptors

### `BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderPasses` (AE `0x1414adfb0`)

Builds and caches the property's `renderPassList` (the passes stay on the property between frames). The
list is rebuilt only when `lastRenderPassState` changes. That state is `(renderMode << 8) | activeLightMask`,
or the list is forced when light lists change, when the shadow light count changes, or when render mode
`0x16` is used. Render mode `0x1b` takes a separate path.

The main lighting pass stores its technique ID in `BSRenderPass::passEnum` as
`descriptor + 0x4800002D`, where `descriptor` is built as follows (`flags` is the 64-bit
`BSShaderProperty::EShaderPropertyFlag` set):

| Descriptor bits | Meaning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 (`0x1`) | VC | `kVertexColors` (bit 37) |
| 1 (`0x2`) | Skinned | `kSkinned` (bit 1) |
| 2 (`0x4`) | ModelSpaceNormals | `kModelSpaceNormals` (bit 12) |
| 3–5 | point light count − 1 (clamped to 7) | light data |
| 6–8 | shadow light count (clamped to 4) | light data |
| 9 (`0x200`) | Specular | `kSpecular` (bit 0) or `kMultiIndexSnow` (bit 41) |
| 10 (`0x400`) | SoftLighting | `kSoftLighting` (bit 57) |
| 11 (`0x800`) | RimLighting | `kRimLighting` (bit 58) |
| 12 (`0x1000`) | BackLighting | `kBackLighting` (bit 59) |
| 13 (`0x2000`) | ShadowDir | directional shadow applies (light assignment, `FUN_1414fcf80`) |
| 14 (`0x4000`) | DefShadow | shadow mask applies (the accumulator's deferred-shadow flag at `+0x178`, distance and alpha conditions) |
| 15 (`0x8000`) | ProjectedUV | `kProjectedUV` (bit 23) with snow/material conditions |
| 16 (`0x10000`) | AnisoLighting | `kAnisotropicLighting` (bit 53) |
| 17 (`0x20000`) | AmbientSpecular | decal/fade conditions |
| 18 (`0x40000`) | WorldMap | LOD objects/land with `kMenuScreen` (bit 55) |
| 20 (`0x100000`) | DoAlphaTest | `NiAlphaProperty` alpha test (flag bit 9) and either the early-Z global or alpha blending/fading; or decals without `kMultiIndexSnow` (see below) |
| 21 (`0x200000`) | Snow | snow shader enabled and `kSnow` |
| 22 (`0x400000`) | CharacterLight | `kCharacterLighting` (bit 40) |
| 23 (`0x800000`) | AdditionalAlphaMask | screen-door fade (`kScreendoorAlphaFade` off, fade node fading) |
| 24–29 | technique | see below |

Technique selection (bits 24–29), later tests win:

| Technique | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Envmap | `kEnvMap` (bit 7) |
| 2 Glowmap | `kGlowMap` (bit 38) |
| 3 Parallax | `kParallax` (bit 11) without `kParallaxOcclusion` (bit 28) |
| 4 Facegen | `kFace` (bit 10) |
| 5 FacegenRGBTint | `kFaceGenRGBTint` (bit 21) |
| 6 Hair | `kHairTint` (bit 18) |
| 7 ParallaxOcc | `kParallaxOcclusion` (bit 28) |
| 8 MTLand | `kMultiTextureLandscape` (bit 14) |
| 19 MTLandLODBlend | `kNoLODLandBlend` (bit 46) |
| 18 LODLandNoise | `kLODLandscape` (bit 33) |
| 13 LODObjects | `kLODObjects` (bit 34) |
| 15 LODObjectHD | `kHDLODObjects` (bit 63) |
| 11 MultilayerParallax | `kMultiLayerParallax` (bit 56) |
| 12 TreeAnim | `kTreeAnim` (bit 61) |
| 14 MultiIndexSparkle | `kMultiIndexSnow` (bit 41) and `kProjectedUV` (bit 23) |
| 16 Eye | `kEyeReflect` (bit 17) |

Bits 6–8, 13, 14 and 20 depend on per-frame engine state rather than on the property:

-   ShadowDir, DefShadow and the shadow light count come from the light and shadow assignment.
-   DoAlphaTest for alpha-tested geometry is `alphaTest && (earlyZ || alphaBlended || fading)`. `earlyZ` is
    the byte at AE `0x14328cc79`: the `ToggleEarlyZ` console command flips it, and two offscreen renders
    set it and clear it around their work (`FUN_1406d2120`, and `FUN_140972590` for mode 1). Whether it
    is set in the main pass therefore depends on what rendered before: after a fresh load it was set in
    Whiterun, after `coc` into Dragonsreach it was clear.

Drawcall Limit Fix takes these bits from the pass the main-camera accumulator holds (see "Batch renderer").

`accumulationHint` (`BSRenderPass+0x1C`) records the batch group the pass goes to: 1 when alpha-blended
and fully faded in, 2/3 for decals, 9/10 for fading, 11 for TreeAnim, 15 for plain opaque with no shadow
work, and so on.

### `BSLightingShader::SetupTechnique` (vtable slot 2, AE `0x1414db810`)

Converts `passEnum` back to a descriptor with `d = passEnum - 0x4800002D`, then:

-   Technique 18 (LODLandNoise) becomes 9 (LODLand) unless a noise global is set; technique 7
    (ParallaxOcc) becomes 0 unless a parallax-occlusion global is set.
-   Vertex descriptor (`FUN_14151c730`): `(d & 0x48007) | ((d & 0x20a00) ? 0x200 : 0) | (d & 0x3f000000)`.
    Only VC, Skinned, ModelSpaceNormals, ProjectedUV, WorldMap, Specular (if Specular, AmbientSpecular
    or RimLighting) and the technique survive, so **light counts never reach the vertex shader**.
-   Pixel descriptor (`FUN_14151c760`): `(d & (0xfffffe05 | ((d >> 1) & 2))) | 1`. Bits 3–8 (light counts)
    are cleared, Skinned is kept only with ModelSpaceNormals, and **VC is always set**.
-   Stores `d` at `BSLightingShader+0x94` (read back by SetupGeometry), then sets per-technique sampler
    address modes and writes the PerTechnique constants.

Community Shaders then rewrites both descriptors in `State::ModifyShaderLookup` (strips shadow, snow,
ambient-specular and lighting-model bits and adds Deferred). The stripped bits still matter: Community
Shaders passes them to the shader in its permutation buffer, and SetupTechnique binds the shadow mask from
them (below).

What SetupTechnique writes (ported in `ConstantEvaluator.cpp` `EvaluateTechnique`):

-   **Sampler filter modes** (`PSTextureFilterMode`): slots 0 and 1 anisotropic (3) always; Envmap adds 4
    and 5, Glowmap 6, Parallax 3. SetupMaterial leaves filter modes alone for the vanilla material types
    (TruePBR's hook sets its own).
-   **VS PerTechnique** (`FUN_1414dfad0`): from the fog property of the current scene graph,
    `BSShaderManager::State` (AE `0x142033060`) → `shadowSceneNode[sceneGraph (+0xC0)]` →
    `ShadowSceneNode+0x220` (`BSFogProperty`):
    -   `FogParam` = `(near / (far − near), 1 / (far − near), power (+0x84), clamp (+0x88))`, or
        `(5000000, 0.1, 1, 0)` when both distances are 0;
    -   `FogNearColor` = `(nearColor (+0x38), BSShaderManager::State::invFrameBufferRange (+0x9C))`;
    -   `FogFarColor` = `farColor (+0x44)`; w is whatever was on the stack.
-   **PS PerTechnique**: `FogColor` = `FogNearColor`; `ColourOutputClamp` = `(fLightingOutputColourClampPostLit,
    PostEnv, PostSpec, 0)` (`[General]` settings at AE `0x142035498`, copied into globals at `0x14338ca0c`
    when the shader is constructed, `FUN_1414dad00`).
-   **Shadow mask** when `(ShadowDir || shadow lights) && DefShadow`: t14 = the shadow mask render
    target's SRV, address mode 0, filter mode `iShadowMaskQuarter:Display != 4 ? 1 : 0`; PS `VPOSOffset` =
    `(1 / width, 1 / height, 0, 0)` of the globals at AE `0x14328be9c` (the shadow mask size).
    **The VPOSOffset write happens after the buffer is unmapped.** On DXVK the dynamic buffer stays mapped,
    so the draw still sees it.

### `BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry` (vtable slot 6, AE `0x1414dd040`)

Per-technique constant writes (constant indices come from the shader's reflected `constantTable`):

-   Envmap/MultilayerParallax/Eye (1, 11, 16): writes the eye-position constant and a material float at
    material `+0x104`.
-   MTLand/MTLandLODBlend (8, 19): land blend parameters from the geometry's parent cell data.
-   LOD techniques (9, 13, 15, 18): two transform uploads (current and previous).
-   TreeAnim (12): wind parameters from the object's `BSTreeNode`-like parent (`vfunc 0x1f8`).
-   Everything not skinned: World and PreviousWorld from `geometry->world` (`+0x7c`) and the previous
    world (`+0xb0`, or the current one when render flag `0x10` is set).
-   Then the directional light: colour scaled by the image-space HDR multiplier, and direction
    transformed into model space unless the shader works in world space (Community Shaders patches it to
    always use world space).

## Scene graph layout

### Cell 3D category nodes

A loaded cell's 3D root (`TESObjectCELL` → `loadedData->cell3D`, returned by `FUN_1402b86e0`) has a fixed
set of child nodes, indexed by position in `cell3D->children`:

| Index | Node | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Actor | actor 3D (skinned bodies, equipped weapons and armor) |
| 1 | Marker | editor markers |
| 2 | Land | terrain (`BSLightingShader` MTLand) |
| 3 | Static | static references |
| 4 | Dynamic | movable references (Havok clutter, doors, activators) |
| 5 | MultiBound | multibound nodes |
| 6 | Water | water planes |

Source: the `ToggleCellNode` console command (`ConsoleFunc::handler::ToggleCellNode`, AE `0x14036ef60`,
help string "0-Actor, 1-Marker, 2-Land, 3-Static, 4-Dynamic, 5-Multibound, 6-Water"), which calls
`FUN_14019f8b0(TES, index, show)`. That helper reads `cell3D->children[index]` and toggles bit 0 of
`NiAVObject::flags` (`+0xF4`, `kHidden`/app-culled) for every loaded cell and the sky cell.

### Multibounds, rooms and portals: where references really hang

References start under the category nodes, but the engine moves many of them elsewhere, and those are
still drawn by the main pass. Everything below is under `TES::objRoot` (`TES+0x80`, named
`ObjectLODRoot`):

-   **Exteriors:** `objRoot` → `BSMultiBoundNode` (no user data) → `NiNode` → the reference's `BSFadeNode`.
    In Whiterun this held about 60% of the eligible static draws (walls, houses, rocks). It is not the
    cell's `loadedData->multiBoundNode`.
-   **Interiors with a portal graph:** the interior cell's `cell3D` is itself a `BSMultiBoundNode` child of
    `objRoot`. The rooms (`BSMultiBoundRoom`, also listed in `loadedData->portalGraph->rooms`) hang under a
    plain `NiNode` child of it, as does `NiNode 'Shared Portal Geometry'` → `BSPortalSharedNode 'Portal
    Shared Geometry'` (`portalGraph->portalSharedNode`). References are moved into their room, including
    actors.
-   Some interior geometry is drawn with **no parent at all** (about 30 draws per frame in Dragonsreach and
    Bleak Falls Barrow), probably the portal graph's `alwaysRenderChildren` or its other object lists.
    Not confirmed.

### `NiNode` child management overrides

`AttachChild` (vtable 0x35) is overridden by `BSFaceGenNiNode`, `NiSwitchNode`,
`BSParticleSystemManager` and `UI3DSceneManager`. The detach and `SetAt` slots are overridden by
`BGSDecalNode`, `NiSwitchNode` and `BSParticleSystemManager`. Every other node class (`BSFadeNode`,
`BSMultiBoundNode`, `BSLeafAnimNode`, …) uses the `NiNode` implementations, so detouring those catches
attachments for static scene content.

## LOD fades in `GetRenderPasses`

Before choosing the technique, `GetRenderPasses` fades some features out by distance. It compares the
property's fade node LOD metric, a float at `BSFadeNode+0x144` (the previous frame's at `+0x148`), with
`[LightingShader]` INI thresholds through `FUN_14147c470(metric, previous, start, end, &fade, &state)`:

-   If `end < metric`, the feature is off (the function returns false).
-   If `metric <= start`, `fade = 1`. Otherwise `fade = clamp((metric - end) / (start - end), 0, 1)`.

| Feature | Thresholds (default) | Effect when off | Fade stored at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Specular (`kSpecular` or `kMultiIndexSnow`) | `fSpecularLODFadeStart/End` (0.09 / 0.10) | clears `kSpecular`, so descriptor bit `0x200` is not set | property `+0x100` (`specularLODFade`) |
| Environment map (`kEnvMap`) | `fEnvmapLODFadeStart/End` (0.09 / 0.10) | clears `kEnvMap` unless `kSnow` is set, so technique Envmap becomes None | property `+0x104` (`envmapLODFade`) |
| Decals (`kDecal`/`kDynamicDecal`, not `kZBufferWrite`) | `fDecalLODFadeStart/End` (0.05 / 0.06) | multiplies the object fade | local |
| Refraction (`kRefraction`/`kTempRefraction`, not `kNoFade`) | `fRefractionLODFadeStart/End` (0.025 / 0.03) | no passes at all | property `+0x104` |

The settings are engine `Setting` objects (AE `0x142033370` onward, 0x18 bytes each: vtable, value, name).
`FUN_1414acf90` copies them into the working globals at AE `0x142033350` to `0x142033368`. Read them by
name with `RE::GetINISetting("fSpecularLODFadeStart:LightingShader")`.

Specular and envmap fades are therefore per-frame inputs to the shader descriptors: in Whiterun about 4%
of the eligible main-pass draws had specular faded out.

## Renderer shadow state and shader constant groups

`BSGraphics::RendererShadowState` (AE base `0x14202ab70`, CommonLib `RendererShadowState::GetRuntimeData`)
is the engine's CPU-side copy of the D3D11 state. The fields the Lighting shader's `Setup*` functions use:

| Offset | Field | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+0x04` | `PSResourceModifiedBits` | dirty bit per pixel texture slot |
| `+0x08` | `PSSamplerModifiedBits` | dirty bit per sampler slot |
| `+0xbc` | `PSTextureAddressMode[16]` | the material's `textureClampMode` (`+0x70`) for material textures |
| `+0xfc` | `PSTextureFilterMode[16]` | set per technique by SetupTechnique (and by TruePBR) |
| `+0x140` | `PSTexture[16]` | `NiSourceTexture->rendererTexture (+0x48)->srv (+0x10)` |
| `+0x348` / `+0x350` | `currentVertexShader` / `currentPixelShader` | `BSGraphics::VertexShader` / `PixelShader` |
| `+0x35c` / `+0x368` | `posAdjust` / `previousPosAdjust` | camera-relative origin, subtracted from world translations |

Texture binds (`FUN_1414e0460(slot, texture, material)`, and `FUN_1414e06b0` for the envmap cube in slot 4)
only write this state; `SetDirtyStates` later flushes it to D3D11.

Constants go through each shader's three constant groups (`PerTechnique`, `PerMaterial`, `PerGeometry`):
`constantBuffers[level] = {ID3D11Buffer*, void* data}` and a `constantTable` that gives each variable's
offset **in floats** (read as an unsigned byte). The Setup functions map the group's buffer with
`WRITE_DISCARD` (only if the buffer pointer is non-null), write `data + table[i] * 4`, unmap, and bind with
`VS/PSSetConstantBuffers(level, …)`. Variable indices are the engine's; Community Shaders reflects its own
shaders into the same index space (`ShaderCache.cpp` `GetVariableIndices`; a variable a permutation lacks
gets offset 0). The engine sometimes writes only part of a float4 (xy of `EnvmapData` and
`LightingEffectParams`, three floats of `EmitColor`); the rest of a discard-mapped buffer is undefined.

### Evaluating the Setup functions outside the render loop

Because the Setup functions reach D3D11 only through the constant-group pointers, they can be run for any
material or pass without drawing:

1.  Point `currentVertexShader`/`currentPixelShader` at stand-in shader objects whose constant buffers are
    null (so nothing is mapped) and whose `constantTable` sends variable *i* to a known float offset of a
    scratch block pre-filled with a sentinel.
2.  Set `BSLightingShader::currentRawTechnique` (`+0x94`) to the pass descriptor.
3.  Call `SetupMaterial` (vtable slot 4) or `SetupGeometry` (slot 6) through the vtable, so every hook on
    them runs too.
4.  Read the scratch blocks and `PSTexture`/`PSTextureAddressMode`, then restore the whole shadow state,
    `currentRawTechnique` and the D3D11 constant buffer bindings of that level (the functions end with
    `VS/PSSetConstantBuffers(level, 1, &nullBuffer)`).

`SetupGeometry` needs a pass whose `numLights > 0`: it dereferences `sceneLights[0]` (the sun) without a
check. `SetupTechnique` cannot be run this way, because it binds real shaders through `BeginTechnique`.

### `SetupGeometry`: what is per object

With Community Shaders' world-space patch (`Hooks.cpp`: `and r15d, 0` at AE `SetupGeometry+0x71`, which
zeroes the model-space flag), everything `SetupGeometry` writes is per frame except:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| VS `World` | row-major 3×4 of `geometry->world`: rotation × scale, translation − `posAdjust` (`FUN_1414aaf10` then `FUN_1414df170`) |
| VS `PreviousWorld` | same from `previousWorld` (or `world` when render flag `0x10` is set), minus `previousPosAdjust` |
| PS `MaterialData` | x = property `envmapLODFade` (Envmap/MultilayerParallax/Eye only), y = `specularLODFade` (Specular only), z = property `alpha` (× fade node `+0x14c` for LOD fade passes) |
| PS `EmitColor` | `*property->emissiveColor × property->emissiveMult` |
| PS `SSRParams.w` | `specularLODFade` when Specular, times 0 if render flag `0x2` |
| PS light counts, point lights, shadow mask select | per-object light assignment; not read by the Light Limit Fix shaders |

The main (deferred) pass calls it with render flags `0x41` or `0x45`.

## Batch renderer: what the main pass will draw

The main-camera `BSShaderAccumulator` (`currentAccumulator`, batch renderer at `+0x130`) holds every pass
the main pass draws; walking it at the start of the main pass gives exactly the passes drawn this frame.

-   `BSBatchRenderer::renderPass` (`+0x08`) is an array of **`PassGroup` structs inline** (0x30 bytes:
    `passes[5]`, `validPassBits`), not the array of pointers CommonLib declares. The engine indexes it
    as `data + (list + group * 6) * 8` (`FUN_1414f39c0`).
-   Each `passes[list]` heads a list chained through `BSRenderPass::passGroupNext` (`+0x30`).
-   `renderPassMap` maps each group's technique ID to its index. The engine reads it raw: bucket count at
    `+0x2C`, buckets of `{ uint32 key, uint32 value, entry* next }` at `+0x48`, end sentinel at `+0x38`.
    An empty bucket has `next == nullptr`.
-   The group's technique ID is what `SetupTechnique` receives, and it can differ from the pass's own
    `passEnum`.
-   `RegisterPass` (AE `0x1414f2a20`, list chosen in `FUN_1414f4790`) puts a pass in list
    `(kTwoSided ? 2 : 0) | (NiAlphaProperty alpha-test bit ? 1 : 0)`, or list 4 for
    `kNoTransparencyMultiSample`. `RenderActivePassRange` draws lists 1, 3 and 4 with alpha testing.
-   A geometry group (`geometryGroups[i]`, 16 of them) has a batch renderer of its own (`+0x00`), which
    `RenderBatches` (AE `0x1414b4fe0`) uses when called with a group index.
-   `BSShaderProperty::renderPassList` holds whatever the **last** `GetRenderPasses` call built. That may
    be another camera's (reflections, cubemaps), so it is not a reliable view of the main pass.

A pass's DoAlphaTest bit is not a stable property of the object. `BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderPasses`
sets it for an alpha-tested property (`NiAlphaProperty` flag bit 9) when either:

-   the early-Z global (AE `0x14328cc79`) is set; or
-   the property is alpha-blended (flag bit 0); or
-   its `alpha * fade`, as computed for the camera the call is building passes for, is below 1.

The product is stored on the property. The pass list is rebuilt only when the property's state changes, and
it is shared by every camera that calls `GetRenderPasses`. The early-Z global is written only by the loading
and menu render loops (`FUN_1406d2120`, `FUN_140972590`) and the `ToggleEarlyZ` console command, so it is
stable in gameplay. Even so, the same object's registered technique gains and loses the bit from frame to
frame, most often while the camera moves, and near objects as well as distant ones. Which camera's
rebuild decides it in a given frame was not pinned down.

What is drawn does not depend on the bit:

-   `SetupAndDrawPass` (AE `0x1414f3dc0`) passes `alphaTest || earlyZ` as the draw's alpha-test flag, and
    lists 1, 3 and 4 are drawn with alpha testing.
-   The main pass tests depth EQUAL against an alpha-tested prepass.
-   In `Lighting.hlsl`, `DO_ALPHA_TEST` adds only the discard (and the screen-door path when
    `AdditionalAlphaMask` is set).

Drawcall Limit Fix therefore draws every pass in lists 1, 3 and 4 with the bit (`DrawnPassDescriptor`).

## Native main-pass render state for opaque lighting objects

Observed at `DrawIndexed` for every eligible draw in the main pass:

-   Draw: `DrawIndexed(triangleCount * 3, 0, 0)` with `rendererData->indexBuffer` (R16, offset 0) and
    `rendererData->vertexBuffer` in slot 0 (stride `vertexDesc.GetSize()`, offset 0).
-   Depth mode `kTestEqual` (the Z-prepass already wrote depth), stencil mode 0, blend mode 0, depth bias 0.
-   Cull mode 0 (none) for `kTwoSided`, 1 (back) otherwise.
-   Alpha test enabled exactly when the `NiAlphaProperty` tests, with reference `alphaThreshold / 255`.
    This is the batch list the pass is in (lists 1, 3 and 4), not the DoAlphaTest descriptor bit.

## Vertex input

When the shadow state's vertex description or vertex shader changes, the renderer looks up an input layout
by `key = currentVertexShader->vertexDesc & shadowState.vertexDesc` (AE `FUN_140e4b5b0`, shadow state
+0x340 and +0x348) in a hash map and builds a missing one with `FUN_140e4bf20`. The key uses the
`VertexDesc` encoding: the stride / 4 in bits 0-3, an offset nibble (in dwords) per attribute `a` at bits
`4a+4`, and presence flags at bits `44+a` (stream 0) and `54+a` (stream 1, dynamic geometry). The shader's
mask sets both flags and the offset nibble of every attribute it consumes (Community Shaders computes it by
reflection in `ShaderCache`). Elements, per attribute present:

| Attribute | Elements | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position (always emitted, offset 0) | POSITION0 | R32G32B32A32_FLOAT |
| Texcoord0 | TEXCOORD0 | R16G16_FLOAT |
| Texcoord1 | TEXCOORD1 | R16G16B16A16_FLOAT |
| Normal, Binormal, Color | NORMAL0, BINORMAL0, COLOR0 | R8G8B8A8_UNORM |
| Skinning | BLENDWEIGHT0 (+0), BLENDINDICES0 (+8) | R16G16B16A16_FLOAT, R8G8B8A8_UNORM |
| Land data | TEXCOORD2 (+0), TEXCOORD3 (+4) | R8G8B8A8_UNORM |
| Eye data | TEXCOORD2 | R32_FLOAT |
| Instance data | TEXCOORD4-7 (+0, +8, +16, +24), per instance | R16G16B16A16_FLOAT |

Bit 54 doubles as the geometry flag CommonLib calls `VF_FULLPREC`; the builder never emits a half-precision
position. DCLF (`VertexInput.cpp`) ports this table.

## Samplers

The state-apply function (AE `FUN_140e4b5b0`) binds each dirty pixel shader sampler slot `s` with
`PSSetSamplers(s, 1, &samplers[PSTextureAddressMode[s] * 5 + PSTextureFilterMode[s]])`, where `samplers` is a
table of `ID3D11SamplerState*` at AE `0x143288210` (4 address modes x 5 filter modes), just before the
`Renderer` singleton. DCLF copies these states' descriptions (`GpuTextures::Sampler`); the table's Address
Library ID is not known yet.

## Main-pass viewport

The main (deferred) pass draws with the viewport at the origin, the dynamic-resolution size (2560 x 1440 of a
3840 x 2160 target at 1.5x upscaling), and depth range [0, 0.999998]. Anything that has to reproduce its depth
values must use the same range.

## Decals: where the main pass draws them, and with what state

Decompiled from AE 1.6.1170 and then measured with `CS_DCLF_DECAL_PROBE=1`, which records the
`RendererShadowState` fields at every native Lighting draw of a decal property inside the deferred pass
and reads the D3D11 descriptions of the state objects they index.

`BSShaderAccumulator::FinishAccumulatingPreResolveDepth` for render mode 0 is `FUN_1414b2d90`: the whole
opaque G-buffer pass. In order: the Lighting range (`1..0x5c00002f`), geometry group 9, grass
(`0x5c000030..0x5c00005c`), groups 8, 1 and 0, sky, group 13, then with `alphaBlendWriteMode = 10`
**`FUN_1414b3bb0`** and with `alphaBlendWriteMode = 11` **`FUN_1414b3d50`**, then the water stencils.
Community Shaders' `Main_RenderWorld_BlendedDecals` hook wraps the second of those and calls `EndDeferred`
after it, so both decal groups draw **inside the deferred pass, into the G-buffer**.

`BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderPasses` gives a Lighting pass of a `kDecal | kDynamicDecal` property
accumulation hint `2 + (alpha < 1 || NiAlphaProperty blending)`. **A hint `h` lands in
`geometryGroups[h + 1]`** (measured: hint 2 draws with the first function's state, hint 3 with the
second's). Hint 4 passes are Utility-shader passes, not Lighting.

| hint | function | groups | depth mode | `rasterStateDepthBiasMode` | write mode | render flags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | `FUN_1414b3bb0` | 3 then 2 | 3 (test and write) | `6 + b` while the `ToggleDepthBias` byte at `0x142032ff6` is set, else 0 (group 3); `8 + b` (group 2) | 10 | 0x41 |
| 3 | `FUN_1414b3d50` | 4 | 1 (test only) | `10 + b`, unconditionally | 11 | 0x45 |

`b` is `DrawWorld::disableSunShadows` (`+0x51`), so interiors use modes 7 and 11. The rasterizer states:
modes 6 and 10 hold `DepthBias -1, DepthBiasClamp -100, SlopeScaledDepthBias -0.65`; modes 7 and 11 hold
no bias at all.

Render flag `0x4` is what applies the geometry's `NiAlphaProperty` (`FUN_1414f5cf0` calls
`FUN_14150bc80(shader, alphaProperty, shaderProperty, alphaTest)` before `SetupGeometry`), so it applies
to hint 3 and not to hint 2. `FUN_14150bc80` sets `alphaBlendMode` from the blend functions when the
property blends: 1 for `SrcAlpha / InvSrcAlpha`, 2 for `SrcAlpha / One`, `One / One` and
`SrcAlpha / InvDestAlpha`, 3 for `DestColor / InvSrcAlpha`, 4 for `Zero / SrcColor` and
`DestColor / Zero`; any other pair leaves the mode as it was. With no blending and `shaderProperty->alpha`
below 1 it picks mode 1 (a fading object). It sets `alphaTestEnabled` from the property's test flag.

`BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry` (`Func6`) treats a decal pass specially in one place: for hint 3 with
`kZBufferWrite` it saves the write mode to `0x142035488` and sets **1**; `RestoreGeometry`
(`1414de3d0`, unnamed in Ghidra) puts the saved value back unless the slot holds its sentinel 13. For a
non-decal pass SetupGeometry is what drops the depth mode to 1 without `kZBufferWrite` and to 0 without
`kZBufferTest`; decal passes keep the group function's depth mode.

The blend states (indices `[alphaBlendMode][alphaToCoverage][writeMode][extra]`, the table at
`RelocationID(524749, 411364)`), as Community Shaders' deferred override leaves them: `[0][0][10][0]` is
blending off on every target with mask F; `[1][0][1][0]` is `SrcAlpha / InvSrcAlpha` on every target with
mask 7 on RT0 and RT3-7 and F on RT1-2; `[1][0][11][0]` is the same blend with mask F everywhere. The
only difference between write modes 1 and 11 is therefore RT0's alpha channel, which the deferred
composite never reads (it writes 1.0 into it).

Measured, Whiterun exterior, per frame: 137.5 hint-2 draws alpha-tested without `kZBufferWrite` plus a
few with; 40.7 hint-3 draws blended and alpha-tested with `kZBufferWrite`, 11.8 blended only without it,
5.9 blended only with it. Dragonsreach: 17 hint 2, 13 hint 3. About 0.5% of hint-3 draws without
`kZBufferWrite` were issued with write mode 1 rather than 11: Community Shaders' Terrain Blending sets
`alphaBlendWriteMode = 1` for its own passes from the same hook, just before the blended decals, and the
first decals after it inherit that until a `kZBufferWrite` decal's save and restore resets it.

## Skinning: the palette the engine keeps, and the buffers a skinned draw uses

Decompiled from AE 1.6.1170 for Drawcall Limit Fix's skinned coverage, and measured with
`CS_DCLF_SKIN_PROBE=1`.

**The draw.** `SetupAndDrawPass` (`FUN_1414f3dc0`) takes a different branch when `geometry->skinInstance`
(`RUNTIME_DATA+0x10`) is set: after the shader's `SetupGeometry` it calls the skin instance's vtable slot
`0x25` (`NiSkinInstance::Func37`, `140d451f0`), which walks `skinPartition->numPartitions` and calls
`NiSkinPartition::Unk_25(args, i)` (`140d43a10`) for each. `BSDismemberSkinInstance::Unk_25` (`140d31f40`)
does the same but skips the partitions whose dismember flag is clear.

**Per partition** (`140d43a10`): a partition whose LOD byte (`Partition+0x42`, CommonLib's `pad42`) is not
enabled in the table at `0x14202a030` for the pass's LOD mode is skipped. Otherwise it calls the shader's
bone setter `NiBoneMatrixSetterI::Func1(skinInstance, &partition, &geometry->world)` and draws
**`partition->buffData`**, the partition's own `BSGraphics::TriShape`, for `partition->triangles`
triangles (renderer vtable `+0x38`, or the instanced `+0x30`). `geometry->rendererData` is a different
TriShape and is not what a skinned shape draws (measured: never equal).

**The setter** (`14150be30`): once per (skin instance, thread) it runs the palette update below, then
copies `skinData->bones * 3` float4 rows from `NiSkinInstance::boneMatrices` (`+0x48`) into a dynamic
constant buffer bound at **VS b10** (`Bones`) and `prevBoneMatrices` (`+0x50`) into **VS b9**
(`PreviousBones`). It is the whole skin's palette, whichever partition is being drawn.

**The update** (`FUN_140e4ff90(skinInstance, const NiTransform* world)`): under the instance's critical
section (`+0x60`), only when `frameID` (`+0x38`) differs from `gFrameCounter`: copies the current palette
to the previous one, (re)allocates `bones * 48` bytes when needed, sets `numMatrices = bones` and
`numRegisters = 3`, builds skin-to-world from `rootParent->world` (`+0x20`), `skinData->rootParentToSkin`
and the world passed in, and writes for every bone with a `boneWorldTransforms[i]`:
`boneWorld * skinToBone`, as **three float4 rows** - row-major 3x4, absolute world space, scale folded in,
translation in each row's `.w`. Idempotent within a frame, so whoever calls it first does the work; a
draw that is withheld from the batch renderer means nobody does, which is why DCLF calls it itself.

**The shader** (`Common/Skinned.hlsli`, `Lighting.hlsl` SKINNED): `actualIndices = 765.01 * BoneIndices`
(the UNORM byte times 255 times 3 is the row index), `GetBoneTransformMatrix` sums four `float3x4` rows
minus a pivot, and the pivot is `VS_PerFrame` c40 (`BonesPivot`) / c41 (`PreviousBonesPivot`) - measured
equal to `posAdjust` / `previousPosAdjust` on every one of 62,000 draws. The skinned position never reads
`World`; `SetupGeometry` does not write `World` / `PreviousWorld` for a skinned pass, so the buffer holds
whatever the previous draw left, and `GetBoneRSMatrix` builds the normal basis from the same rows.

**What the main pass draws, per frame.** Whiterun exterior: ~200 skinned Lighting draws, all tracked;
the largest class is one-partition `NiSkinInstance` shapes with 4 bones (47, technique 0), then
three-partition shapes with LOD bytes 1/2/0 and technique 12 (29, hint 11: tree-animated, one partition
per LOD level), then actor parts (`BSDismemberSkinInstance`, one or two draws each). Dragonsreach: ~130,
dominated by one-partition books (`Book01a`, 3 bones, hint 15) and banners (2 bones). 191 of 201 palettes
in the exterior and 288 of 328 in Dragonsreach changed between consecutive frames, so a static-pose skip
would buy little.

### Skin partitions: which ones a draw draws

Decompiled from AE 1.6.1170 for Drawcall Limit Fix's tree and actor coverage.

-   **The test.** `NiSkinPartition::Unk_25` (`140d43a10`) draws partition *i* when the byte at `0x14202a030`
    indexed by `((LODMode.index + LODMode.singleLevel * 4) * 3 + Partition+0x42)` is non-zero.
    -   The table is 24 constant bytes (`00 00 00 01 00 00 01 01 00 01 01 01 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00`),
        read only by this function and `FUN_140d43b00`.
    -   Cumulative level *n* draws the LOD bytes below *n*. Single-level *n* draws LOD byte *n* alone.
-   **Dismember skins.** `BSDismemberSkinInstance::Unk_25` (`140d31f40`) first skips partition *i* when byte
    0 of its 4-byte `Data` entry (`editorVisible`) is clear. With no `Data` array it falls back to the
    plain loop.
-   **The level.** `GetRenderPasses` (`1414adfb0`) and `GetRenderPasses_ShadowMapOrMask` (`1414af030`) give a
    pass `LODMode` 3 (cumulative), or for geometry with `kMeshLOD` (`NiAVObject` flag bit 27) the fade node's
    `+0x152 & 0xF`. `GetRenderPasses` skips this for an accumulator with `+0xB9` set.
-   **The cross-fade.** While a `kMeshLOD` geometry's fade node has `(+0x153 & 0x70) != 0x20`,
    `GetRenderPasses` appends a copy of each lighting pass with accumulation hint 10 and
    `LODMode = (+0x152 & 0xF) | singleLevel`.
-   **Buffers.** A tree's partitions share one vertex buffer and have separate index buffers (measured).
-   **How the cross-fade copy is drawn.** It is not a plain second draw. `BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry`
    (`1414dd040`, ID 107300) makes three differences:
    -   **Material alpha.** For a pass with `LODMode & 0x80` (the single-level copy), the PS constant at
        `MaterialData.z` is `property.alpha * fadeNode[+0x14C]`, not `property.alpha`.
    -   **Stencil.** For accumulation hint 10 it sets `depthStencilStencilMode = 0xB` and
        `stencilRef = int(f * 31.0)` (`0x1419de7e0`). `f` is `fadeNode[+0x14C]` for the copy and
        `fadeNode[+0x130]` for a hint-10 pass without the single-level bit (the other hint-10 case in
        `GetRenderPasses`, a fade).
    -   **Order.** Hint 10 lands in the batch renderer's geometry group 10, which `1414b3390` draws just
        before the main opaque range.
    -   So the cross-fade is a stencil dither with 32 levels, against whatever the stencil buffer holds
        there.
    -   **The base pass is unchanged.** Hints 0, 11 and 15, cumulative `LODMode` of the new level, get
        neither change: it draws exactly like a settled object.
    -   **State layout.** The renderer state is at `0x14202ab70`: `+0x88` depth mode, `+0x90` stencil mode,
        `+0x94` stencil ref, `+0xA8` blend mode, `+0xB0` write mode (CommonLib's `RendererShadowState`).

### Switch nodes

`NiSwitchNode::OnVisible` (`140d29700`) culls `children[index]` alone, and nothing when `index < 0`. When
`childRevID[index] != revID` it first runs the child's `UpdateDownwardPass`, from the cull. `UpdateDownwardPass`
(`140d29240`) with flag bit 0 set bumps `revID` and updates only the selected child; with it clear it
updates every child like an `NiNode`.

Offsets on SE and AE:

| Offset | Field |
| --- | --- |
| `+0x128` | flags (u16) |
| `+0x12C` | index (i32) |
| `+0x130` | savedTime |
| `+0x134` | revID |
| `+0x138` | childRevID, an `NiTPrimitiveArray`: data at `+0x140`, capacity at `+0x148` |

CommonLib-NG declares these fields after `NiNode`, whose declared size in a multi-runtime build is VR's.
Reading them as members therefore reads the wrong memory.

### BSLightingShader::SetupMaterial: where every material constant comes from

Vanilla `BSLightingShader::SetupMaterial` (vfunc 4, `1414dc310`, AE). `this` is the shader, the argument is
the `BSLightingShaderMaterialBase`, and the technique is `this+0x94`. It writes the PerMaterial groups: PS
variable *i* through the register table at `0x14202aec0 + 0x40 + i`, VS variable *i* through
`0x14202aeb8 + 0x50 + i`.

CS replaces the function for TruePBR materials (`TruePBR::BSLightingShader_SetupMaterial`). Advanced Skin
and TerrainHelper hook it too, but only bind extra textures outside the engine's slots (t71-t74).

Sources:

-   **M:** the material's own fields.
-   **S:** the shader object, per frame.
-   **G:** engine globals, per frame.
-   **R:** a render target, per frame.

| Output | Written when | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t0 diffuse | always (not for MTLand / LODLand) | M `+0x48`; or R `renderTargets[M +0x50]` when `+0x50 != -1` |
| t1 normal | always (same) | M `+0x58` |
| t2 specular | flag `0x4` with Specular | M `+0x68` |
| t9 | flag `0x1000` | M `+0x68` |
| t12 | flag `0x400` or `0x800` | M `+0x60` |
| t11 character light | flag `0x400000` (CharacterLight) | R `renderTargets[FUN_1414e8b30(0x142033da8)]` |
| per-technique textures | technique 1-4, 7, 9/0x12, 0xb, 0x10 | M `+0xa0`, `+0xa8`, `+0xb0`, ... |
| texture address modes | with each texture | M `+0x70` |
| VS 11 TexcoordOffset | always | M `+0xc/+0x10` offset and `+0x1c/+0x20` scale, pair `[G 0x142033180]` (the texture-transform buffer the frame reads) |
| VS 9/10 Left/RightEyeCenter | technique 0x10 (eye) | M `+0xb4..+0xc8` |
| PS 6 | flag `0x20000` | G `0x14203315c..` |
| PS 21 EnvmapData | technique 1, 0xb | M `+0xb0` / `+0xc8`, and whether the mask texture exists |
| PS 22 ParallaxOccData | technique 7 only | M `+0xa8`, `+0xac` |
| PS 23 TintColor | technique 5, 6 | M `+0xa0..+0xa8` |
| PS 24 LODTexParams | technique 8/0x13, 9/0x12 | M `+0x148..+0x150` or `+0xb8..+0xc0`; `.z` from G `0x142032fda` |
| PS 25 SpecularColor | flag `0x200` | M `+0x38..+0x40` times `+0x8c`; `.w` M `+0x88` |
| PS 26 SparkleParams | technique 0xe | M `+0xa0..+0xac` |
| PS 27 MultiLayerParallaxData | technique 0xb | M `+0xb8..+0xc4` |
| PS 28 LightingEffectParams | flag `0x400` or `0x800` | M `+0x90`, `+0x94` |
| PS 29 IBLParams | always | S `+0xcc`, then `+0xd0..` or `+0xe0..` by S `+0xf0` |
| PS 30-33 landscape snow and spec-power | MTLand, flag `0x200000` | M `+0x118..+0x144`; `.z` of 31 from G `0x142035548`, `.w` 1/G `0x1420355f0` |
| PS 34 SnowRimLightParameters | flag `0x200000` | G `0x142035590`, `0x1420355a8`, `0x1420355c0`, `0x1420355d8` |
| PS 35 CharacterLightParams | flag `0x400000` | G `0x14203316c..`, zero unless full-bright mode |

-   **Unlisted variables:** anything not in the table is not written by `SetupMaterial`. The buffer keeps
    whatever the previous draw left there.
-   **Where DCLF saw staleness:** every value DCLF found stale in its material records (TexcoordOffset, t11,
    IBLParams) is an **M** field written after the record was taken, or an **S/G/R** source that changes
    per frame. No other kind of source exists in this function.
### Material writers, and the texture-transform buffers

-   **Two texture-transform buffers.** A material keeps two sets of UV offset and scale
    (`+0x0c/+0x10` and `+0x1c/+0x20`, 8 bytes apart per buffer).
    -   Every `SetupMaterial` reads the set at `0x142033180` (`BSShaderManager::State::
        textureTransformCurrentBuffer`): Lighting, Effect and Utility alike.
    -   `Main::Update` flips it once a frame (`1406460c7`: `xor [0x142033180], 1`); two menu functions
        flip it too.
-   **`BSLightingShaderPropertyFloatController::Update`** (`14150dde0`, vtable `0x141ac3be8` slot 0x27)
    returns early when its value is unchanged. Otherwise it writes, by its type (`+0x50`):
    -   type 0xb: the property's `+0xf8` (the emissive multiplier);
    -   types above 0x13: the texture-transform buffer `current ^ [0x142033184]`. That offset is 1 in play,
        so the write lands in the buffer the next frame reads; `Inventory3DManager::Render` and `StatsMenu`
        set it to 0;
    -   anything else: the material (`property+0x78`), at an offset from a table filled at startup
        (`0x1435ef210`).
-   **`BSLightingShaderPropertyColorController::Update`** (`14150ea50`, slot 0x27): type 1 writes the
    property's emissive colour (`+0xf0`); any other type a material colour (table `0x1435ef298`).
-   **`BSLightingShaderPropertyUShortController::Update`** (`14150e580`) is `ret 0`.
-   **In-place rewrites.** `BSShaderMaterial::CopyMembers` (02), and `BSLightingShaderMaterialBase::
    OnLoadTextureSet` (08), `ClearTextures` (09) and `ReceiveValuesFromRootMaterial` (0A). Per class,
    vtables `0x141ab6eb8` (Base) to `0x141ab7458` (MultiLayerParallax), and `0x14185dc08`
    (BSLightingShaderMaterial).


## The depth pass and first person

`Main::RenderDepth` (AE `1414ccb30`, ID 107139; SE ID 100421) is called from `Main::Draw` (AE `+0x395`)
as `RenderDepth(firstPerson, …)`. The flag is set when the player's first-person 3D is shown. In order:

1.  **The world.** `FUN_1414a9190(worldCamera, accumulator, 0x21)` renders the scene: it calls
    `BSGraphics::State::SetCameraData` for the world camera and runs the accumulator. `FUN_1414b47e0` and
    `FUN_1414b5120` (called at `+0x1AA`) then clear the accumulator's lists.
2.  **Rooms.** With portals in play, a loop draws each room again with stencil reference `room + 1`.
3.  **The first-person model**, when the flag is set:
    -   it reads the viewport depth range, sets it to `[0, 0.1]` (or another bound for the second argument)
        and later restores it;
    -   the model is drawn with the first-person camera (`0x14338c820`), and the eye (`posAdjust`) moves to
        the player's head;
    -   **it does not restore the camera.** `Main::Draw` sets the world camera again only after `RenderDepth`
        returns (`SetCameraData(p0, 1)`, a few calls later). Terrain Blending sets it before calling
        `RenderDepth` for the same reason.
4.  **The copy.** `CopyResource(kPOST_ZPREPASS_COPY, kMAIN depth)` on the immediate context (vtable slot 47).

At the call site's return in first person, then, the eye is the first-person camera's (DCLF measured
`(0, 0, 120.5)` against the world's `(17120, -47226, 9.7)`). The VS_PerFrame projection is also its own, with
a near plane of 5 against 15, and the viewport depth range is still `[0, 0.1]`.

## ProjectedUV and MTLand: the per-object constants and where they come from

Decompiled from AE 1.6.1170 for Drawcall Limit Fix's coverage of the two techniques; both are
`BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry` (`Func6`, `1414dd040`) work, and one helper.

**MTLand and MTLandLODBlend (techniques 8 and 19): `LandBlendParams`** (VS PerGeometry variable 3).
`xy` are `BSLightingShaderMaterialLandscape::landBlendParams.rg` (the property's material, `+0x108`).
`zw` are a position blended between two `BSShaderManager::State` points minus the geometry's world
translation:

    t  = clamp((State+0x20 - State+0xb8) * (float at 0x141ad2840 / State+0x98), 0, 1)
    z  = lerp(State+0xa8, State+0xb0, t) - world.translate.x
    w  = lerp(State+0xac, State+0xb4, t) - world.translate.y

with `State` at `0x142033060`. When `t` reaches 1 the function also clears the byte at `0x14332a394`.
Nothing else in the case is per object; the six landscape texture sets come from `SetupMaterial`.

**ProjectedUV (descriptor bit 15, any technique but Hair): `TextureProj`** (VS PerGeometry variable 6,
three rows). The projection is a `NiTransform` with a fixed rotation about Z
(`[[0,1,0],[-1,0,0],[0,0,1]]`, from the constant at `0x141abe6a0`), translation `posAdjust`, scale 1,
converted by `FUN_1414aaf10` (NiTransform to row-major 4x4, translation minus `posAdjust`, so it comes
out at zero). For technique 1 (Envmap) the matrix is that projection alone; for everything else the
geometry's world transform is converted the same way, `posAdjust` is added back to its translation (so it
is the absolute world matrix, with one rounding trip), and `D3DXMatrixMultiply(world, projection)`
(`14153d3c8`) gives `M`. `TextureProj` row `r` is **column** `r` of `M`: `(M[0][r], M[1][r], M[2][r],
M[3][r])`.

The same block binds four pixel textures with address mode 3 and filter mode 1: slot 11 from
`BSShaderManager::State+0x48 -> +0x10` and slots 3, 8 and 10 from the three `NiTexture` globals at
`0x14328cc28/30/38` (through `rendererTexture` `+0x48` then `+0x10`), the ones the
`ReloadProjectedUVTextures` console command replaces. DCLF captures the four views from a native
projected draw rather than dereferencing the globals.

**The pixel parameters** (PS PerGeometry variables 12-14) are written by `FUN_1414e00c0(shader,
dynamicData, property, projectedNormals)` at the end of that block, for a static shape from the
**property's** fields:

| variable | value |
| --- | --- |
| 12 `ProjectedUVParams` | `x = (1 - p.a) * p.r`, `z = p.b`, `w = (1 - p.a) * p.g + p.a` from `projectedUVParams` (`+0x10C`); **y is never written** |
| 13 `ProjectedUVParams2` | `projectedUVColor` (`+0x11C`), all four |
| 14 `ProjectedUVParams3` | `(float at 0x142035560, float at 0x142035578, 0, projectedNormals ? 1 : 0)` |

`projectedNormals` is the byte at `0x142035518`, unless render flag `0x8` is set together with the byte
at `0x142035530` (the main pass runs with `0x41` / `0x45`, so it is the first byte alone).

**The tree amplitude's square root, on garbage.** `SetupGeometry`'s TreeAnim case takes the node's
squared distance (`+0x158`) through `0x5f3759df - (bits >> 1)` with an **arithmetic** shift of the bit
pattern. A fern-type node can hold an uninitialised negative value there; the engine's estimate then
overflows in the direction that clamps the amplitude to its maximum, and a logical shift does not. DCLF
reproduces the signed shift.

## Shadow maps: views, descriptors and the Utility passes

Measured with `CS_DCLF_SHADOW_PROBE=1` (`DrawcallLimitFix/ShadowProbe.cpp`) on AE 1.6.1170, Whiterun
exterior by day and the Bannered Mare at hour 22, on top of the Ghidra reading of the functions below.

**Frame order.** `Main::Draw` (`0x1406444b0`) builds the main scene lists and finishes them; then
`NiCamera::CalculateAndDrawShadowCasterLights` (`0x1414cbb90`) queues each shadow light's list
accumulation and, inside `CalculateActiveShadowCasterLights` (`0x1414cc570`), walks
`ShadowSceneNode::GetShadowCasterLightArrayEntry` (`0x1414a4010`, an index into `shadowLightsAccum` at
`+0x230`) calling `UpdateCamera` (vfunc 0x10) and `Accumulate` (vfunc 0x9, one `FUN_1414f0920` cull per
descriptor). `FUN_1414cbff0`, the callee of Community Shaders' `Main_RenderShadowMaps` thunk
(`RelocationID(35560,36559)+0x2EC/0x30A`), then queues the **main camera's pass registration jobs** and,
while they run, calls every light's `Render` (vfunc 0xA), and only then `JobList__Finish`es. So at
shadow-draw time the scene graph and the main cull are final, the shadow views' registrations are
complete, and the main accumulator's passes are not - they are complete when the thunk returns.

**Per light.** `BSShadowDirectionalLight::Render` (`0x141511d60`), `BSShadowFrustumLight::Render`
(`0x14151aac0`) and `BSShadowParabolicLight::Render` (`0x14151bd10`) loop their `ShadowmapDescriptor`s
(0xF0 bytes, `RE::BSShadowLight::ShadowmapDescriptor`) into `BSShadowLight::RenderShadowmap`
(`0x1414f0cf0`, mislabelled `BSShadowParabolicLight::sub`): a free array slice from the bitmask at
`0x142035797` when `renderTarget == -1`, `SetDepthStencilTarget(descriptor.renderTarget, slice)`, a clear
when `clearRenderTarget`, then `FUN_1414a90f0(camera, accumulator, flags | 0x400)`:
`State::SetCameraData` (the shadow camera into `cameraData` and `posAdjust`), `UpdateViewPort`, the
accumulator's vfunc 0x25, **`FinishAccumulatingPreResolveDepth` (vfunc 0x2A)** and `PostResolveDepth`
(0x2B); afterwards it writes `descriptor.lightTransform` (what CS uploads to t98). Parabolic lights set
`0x142035df8` (the light radius) and `0x142035dfc` (+1 / -1) before each hemisphere.

**The views, as drawn.**

| Light | Descriptors | Render mode | Depth target / slice | Viewport |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Directional (sun) | 2 cascades | `0xE` ShadowMapClamped | 2 (`kSHADOWMAPS_ESRAM`), slices 0 and 1 | `(0,0) 4096x4096`, full slice |
| Directional, focus shadow | descriptor 0 of `focusShadowmapDescriptors` when `drawFocusShadows` | `0xE` | 4, slice 4 | `(0,3547) 549x549` - **an origin** |
| Parabolic (point) | 2 hemispheres | `0xF` ShadowMapPb | 4, one slice per light | `(0,0) 4096x2048` and `(0,2048) 4096x2048` - **an origin** |
| Frustum (spot) | (none in the cells measured) | `0xE` by the decompile | | |

`ShadowMapPlain` (`0xD`, technique bits `0x4000`) was never used. The `shadowLightsAccum` list holds a
second directional light whose descriptors are never drawn, and the focus descriptors 1..3 have a zero
port and no clear. A view's `port` (`NiRect`: left, right, top, bottom, y up) matches the viewport's
size; the hemispheres and the focus shadow are sub-rectangles of the slice, so any render pass that
draws a view needs a viewport origin, not just a size. Render flags at the hook are `0x400`. The
depth-stencil set mode is 4 (no clear at bind; the clear was done before). Point lights: `parabola =
(radius, ±1)`, e.g. 579 for a hearth. The main pass's `RenderDepth` accumulations (mode `0xC`) come
through the same vfunc twice per frame.

**The passes.** `BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderPasses_ShadowMapOrMask` (`0x1414af030`, from
`GetRenderPasses` vfunc 0x2A for modes 0xC..0xF): `technique = DetermineUtilityShaderDecl()` (vfunc
0x3D) `| 0x80` when the alpha property alpha-tests `| 0x2000` (0xC) / `0x4000` (0xD) / `0xC000` (0xE) /
`0x14000` (0xF) `| 0x10000` when LOD-dissolving (0xC only) `| 0x8000000` when flags bit 34 or 63
`| 0x20080` when flags bit 26 or 27; `passEnum = technique + 0x2B`, cached per property in the
double-buffered `arrayQueue` across views of a frame. **For Utility passes the `techniqueID` handed to
`BSBatchRenderer::RegisterPass` is the `passEnum` itself** (unlike Lighting, where it is the descriptor).
The probe derived the technique from the property for ~1M registrations with **0 differing**.
Accumulation hints seen: 0 (most), 3, 7, 11. Exterior day: ~2,680 Utility registrations per frame into
the views (216 cascade 0, ~2,450 cascade 1, 9 focus) and ~2,450 `0x2000`-bit (RenderDepth) ones into a
renderer that is neither a view's nor one of the main pass's batch renderers.

**Who casts.** For the shadow modes the function returns no pass when: the property is not a lighting
one; hair-tint flag (bit 18) with a decal flag (26/27) unless `kZBufferWrite` (32) and alpha-blended;
`fadeNode->currentFade * material->materialAlpha < 1`; flags `0x8004` (`kTempRefraction`,
`kRefraction`); alpha-blended (non-decal); `kCastShadows` (bit 9) clear while the byte at `0x142033498`
is 1 (it is 1 here; 2 selects volumetric copies for 0xE with the accumulator's `+0x12E` flag);
`DetermineUtilityShaderDecl() == 0`. The rule reproduced in the probe rejected **none** of the engine's
registered casters. Of the main pass's kept objects without a registration in a cascade (~475 per
frame in the exterior), 40 were alpha-blended and the rest eligible - outside the cascades' cull.

**The constants** (`BSUtilityShader::SetupGeometry` `0x1414fae40`, `SetupMaterial` `0x1414faa60`,
`SetupTechnique` `0x1414fa160`; `package/Shaders/Utility.hlsl`). VS `PerGeometry` (b2): `ShadowFadeParam`
c0, `World` c1..c4 (row-major, translation in column 3 - the Lighting layout - and **eye-relative to
the shadow camera's `posAdjust`**: `FUN_1414aaf10` subtracts the current `posAdjust`, which the
directional camera puts up to 15,000 units from the main eye), `EyePos` c5, `TreeParams` c7. VS
`PerMaterial` (b1): `TexcoordOffset` c0 (`texCoordOffset`, `texCoordScale`), bound only for alpha-tested
draws. VS `PerTechnique` (b0): `HighDetailRange` c0, `ParabolaParam` c1 = `(1 / radius, ±1)`. The pixel
shader is bound only for alpha-tested draws, and its `PerGeometry` group is **not** - the alpha
reference reaches it as `AlphaTestRefRS` (b11) from `RendererShadowState.alphaTestRef`. `VS_PerFrame`
(b12) `c8..c11` holds the **transpose** of `cameraData.viewProjMat` at the 0x2A hook, and `posAdjust`
at the draw equals the one at the hook. Rasterizer state per draw: cull modes 0 and 1 (two-sided and
back), fill 0; the cascade depth-bias mode is read off the draws in S2.

**Cost.** Exterior day: 2.3 ms of render-thread CPU per frame inside the shadow-map call (max 3.6),
all in the directional light: cascade 1 with 2,569 draws takes 2.2 ms (0.86 µs per draw), cascade 0
with 236 draws 0.23 ms, the focus view 0.014 ms. Bannered Mare at night: two point lights, 4
hemispheres, ~1,500 draws, 0.5 ms.

**The volumetric copy (measured, S2).** Each cascade's accumulator is finished twice per frame: once
with `depthStencil = kSHADOWMAPS_ESRAM` (target 2, 4096², two slices) and once with
`kVOLUMETRIC_LIGHTING_SHADOWMAPS_ESRAM` (target 3, 512², two slices, `D16_UNORM` like the others) for
the volumetric lighting. `FinishAccumulatingPreResolveDepth` (vfunc 0x2A) fires for each, with the same
view (accumulator) and render mode 0xE. They do **not** draw the same passes:

-   `Render` draws the copies first, with flag `0x100`, and only while the byte at `0x142033498` is 2.
    It is 2 in the current setup; the probe above ran with it at 1.
-   The mode's draw function (`FUN_1414b44f0`, mode 0xE in the table at `0x14332b120`) draws only batch
    group 15 when the flag is set, and never draws group 15 without it.
-   Group 15 holds the passes registered with accumulation hint 8: the volumetric-only casters, meaning
    Lighting objects without `kCastShadows` while the byte is 2.
-   Measured (`CS_DCLF_VOLUMETRIC_PROBE`, road, Riverwood, Ivarstead, Winterhold): 71-93 geometries a
    frame, all static `BSTriShape` terrain pieces (mountains, cliffs, road), none also drawn into a
    cascade.

**Registration by hint.** The shadow modes' registration function (`FUN_1414b2a60`, modes 0xC-0x11 of the
table at `0x14332b020`, filled by `FUN_14147e2c0`) sends a pass with hint 11, 7, 3 or 8 straight into
batch group 9, 1, 4 or 15 with `FUN_1414f5090(batch, pass, group)`, a direct call. Only the other hints
go through `BSBatchRenderer::RegisterPass` (vfunc 2). The main mode (`FUN_1414b2330`) does the same for
most hints. Confirmed for hint 8: `VolumetricProbe` saw none arrive at the `RegisterPass` hook, yet about 80
a frame were drawn. **Unresolved for 3, 7 and 11:** the S1 probe above recorded hints 3, 7 and 11 at that
hook. Those may be registrations into a geometry group's own batch renderer, which is a different path.
Before relying on either reading for those hints, check it with a counter on the `FUN_1414f5090` call
sites.

**The sun's focus shadow is drawn every frame.** In the third-person exterior runs, the directional
light draws one focus view a frame: target 4 (`kSHADOWMAPS`), slice 4, 546x546, flags `0x400`, about 9 NPC
draws. It is accumulated by `BSShadowDirectionalLight::sub` (`0x1414f0480`, called from
`CalculateAndDrawShadowCasterLights` when the setting byte `0x142032fd0` is set and `DAT_14332a498`
counts focus descriptors). It is drawn by `Render`'s third loop (gated on `unk558`, view type 4).

## The sun's accumulation: what it writes, and who reads it

`NiCamera::CalculateAndDrawShadowCasterLights` (`0x1414cbb90`), for the sun, in order:

1.  `UpdateCamera` (vfunc 0x10).
2.  The focus accumulation, `BSShadowDirectionalLight::sub`, when enabled.
3.  The mask bookkeeping: `light+0x520 = count`, and the frame's shadow-light bit into `DAT_14338c90c`.
4.  The full-frustum cull, `FUN_141511f30(light, &DAT_14338c870, ...)`:
    -   Per process in `light+0x580`, it queues a cull job (`FUN_1414bf730`) on the scene-list job list,
        which fills that process's `objectArray` (`+0x128`, count `+0x138`).
    -   It closes with `FUN_1414bf320(..., 1, 1)`, which culls with no accumulator.
    -   The only consumer of these arrays found is `Accumulate`, which is passed
        `&fullFrustumCullingProcessArray`.

`BSShadowDirectionalLight::Accumulate` (vfunc 9, `0x141511c80`), per cascade:

1.  It sets the cascade accumulator's `+0x160` to the global shadow-light count + 1 and `+0x164` to
    `1 << count`, plus `+0x168` (the cascade index) and `+0x12E` (the volumetric flag).
2.  `FUN_1414f0920` calls `FUN_1414b47d0(accumulator)`, which is an empty stub.
3.  `FUN_1414bf320(..., 2)` walks each full-frustum process's `objectArray` against the cascade
    (`FUN_140e305c0`). `FUN_140e28af0` then hands every culled geometry to the accumulator's registration,
    `FUN_1414b2140`.
4.  It **increments the global shadow-light count** (`*param_3 += 1`). The sun's two cascades take two
    bits, and every later shadow light's bit is offset by them.

`FUN_1414b2140`, for every geometry handed to it:

-   It calls the mode's registration function. For shadows that is `FUN_1414b2a60`, which writes
    `property->lastAccumulatedFrameCount = gFrameCounter` and registers the passes.
-   Then **`property->lightData->activeLightMask |= accumulator+0x164`**. When `+0x160` is `0xFFFF`, it
    clears the mask to 0 instead.
-   The mask bit is set for every geometry that reaches the call, whether or not it produced a pass.

**Who reads `activeLightMask`: the main pass.** `BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderPasses` reads it
during the main camera's registration, which runs after the shadow lights accumulate:

-   `lastRenderPassState = (mode << 8) | activeLightMask` decides whether the pass list is rebuilt.
-   `FUN_1414fcdb0(lightData)` counts the non-directional shadow lights among the mask's bits
    (`pass->shadowLightCount`).
-   For the sun, it loops over `sunShadowDirLight->shadowMapCount` bits and stores the cascades this
    object is registered in into pass byte `+0x1D`. When that is 0, the pass descriptor loses
    `0x61C0`: ShadowDir (13), DefShadow (14) and the shadow light count (6-8).

So an object samples the sun's shadow mask in the main pass only if the sun's accumulation registered it
in a cascade that frame. Skipping that accumulation changes main-pass techniques unless those bits are
set some other way. `lastAccumulatedFrameCount` has no reader found yet.

**Who clears the masks.** `FUN_1414cb640`, which `Main::Draw` calls before the shadow lights accumulate (at
`0x140644d7e`), writes accumulator `0x14338c840`'s `+0x160` as the 8-byte `0xFFFF` (so `+0x164` becomes 0) while
`DAT_14338c911` is 0. It then registers culling process `0x14338c640`'s culled geometries through that accumulator
(`FUN_140e28af0`), and the registration zeroes their masks. Each shadow light then ORs its bits in.

**The main camera's registration reads the mask, then clears it.** Its accumulators also have `+0x160 = 0xFFFF`, so
`FUN_1414b2140` runs `GetRenderPasses` with the frame's bits and then zeroes the mask. Every registration of the same
geometry later in the frame (the reflections, the depth accumulations) reads 0. Measured with DCLF's sun entry
exclusion probe: ignoring this, a fifth of the later registrations disagreed.

**`FUN_1414b2140`'s early-outs**, before the mode's registration and the mask write. It returns at once when:

-   the skin instance is a `BSDismemberSkinInstance` whose byte `+0x98` is 0;
-   the geometry has no shader property (`+0x128`);
-   it has neither renderer data (`+0x138`) nor a skin instance, its vfunc `0x10` returns null, and its type
    byte (`+0x150`) is not `0xB`.

It writes no mask when the accumulator's `+0x160` is 0, or the property's `lightData` (`+0x70`) is null.

**The rest of the sun's accumulation** (AE 1.6.1170):

-   `Accumulate` sets each cascade's fields and calls `FUN_1414f0920`. That function calls `FUN_1414b47d0`
    (an empty stub), culls, registers, and increments the count (`*param_3 += 1`). Nothing else.
-   `FUN_140e28af0(process, accumulator)` registers everything a culling process kept: its `+0x128` list
    (count `+0x138`), then its bucketed lists. `FUN_1414bf320(ctx, 2)` gets there through `FUN_140e305c0` and
    `FUN_140e28f70`. `FUN_140e28f70` calls the process's vfunc `0xB8` for the first entry and `0xB0` for the
    rest, and with its `param_4` set it skips entries whose `+0xF4` bit 0 (app-culled) is set.
-   The array `FUN_140e305c0` hands `FUN_140e28f70` is the full-frustum process's `objectArray` (`+0x128`, a
    `BSTArray<NiPointer<NiAVObject>>`, size at `+0x138`), the same one for every cascade. The first entry's vfunc
    `0xB8` (`Process(camera, scene, visibleSet)`) is what sets the cascade process's frustum and planes up from the
    cascade's camera; with an empty array it keeps the previous cascade's.
-   The cascade's cull context (`FUN_1414bf2b0` builds it, `FUN_1414f0920` fills it): the accumulator (`+0x48` of the
    descriptor), the camera (`+0x40`), cull mode 3 or 4 (`light+0x47`), the custom planes from the descriptor's
    `+0xE0` block when its `+0x11F` is set, and `cameraRelatedUpdates` and `updateAccumulateFlag` both 0. The process
    is the static one at `0x14332bda0` (the context's `+0x5C` is 0).
-   The full-frustum cull (`FUN_141511f30`) queues one job per scene list (`FUN_1414bf730`), then runs
    `JobList__Begin` and `Finish` itself, so the render thread waits for it. Each process's `planes` are
    refreshed by that cull, from the light's full-frustum camera (`+0x578`).
-   The focus view does not depend on any of this. `sub` only builds the focus cameras, and `Render`'s third
    loop accumulates the focus view itself.

**Measured** (Riverwood, render thread per frame, `CS_DCLF_SUN_TIMING`):

| Part | Mean | Max |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full-frustum cull | 0.044 ms | 0.23 ms |
| `Accumulate` | 0.69 ms | 1.25 ms |
| … of which registration (about 2,580 geometries) | 0.41 ms | |

The registration figure includes the probe's own timing overhead.

## The occlusion maps: precipitation, and Skylighting's

Two views draw the scene's depth from above into depth target 10 (`kPRECIPITATION_OCCLUSION_MAP`, 512x512): the
engine's precipitation mask, when there is a current or last precipitation object, and Community Shaders'
Skylighting height map, every exterior frame. Skylighting replaces the engine's call at `Main::Draw` +0x3A1 with its
own `RenderOcclusion`, which runs both through the engine's `Precipitation::SetupMask` and `RenderMask`, pointing the
occlusion camera in a new sky direction each frame and swapping target 10's texture for its own (`texOcclusion`).
Measured at Riverwood (clear weather, so Skylighting's alone), render thread per frame: `SetupMask` 0.43 ms,
`RenderMask` 0.34 ms.

-   **`SetupMask`** (`0x1404081c0`): the occlusion camera's projection (`FUN_140408520`), then for each of the six
    scene lists (`DAT_14338c870`, count `DAT_14338c880`, 0x18 bytes each) `FUN_1414bf320(ctx, 1)`: the list culled
    by `FUN_140e28f70` with the occlusion data's `BSGeometryListCullingProcess`, cull mode 3, and
    `cameraRelatedUpdates` 0, then registered through the occlusion accumulator (`FUN_140e28af0`), on the render
    thread.
-   **The registration**, render mode `0x1C` (`FUN_1414b2c20` in the table at `0x14332b020`): the property's vfunc
    `0x2D` (`GetRenderPasses_Occlusion`), each pass inserted straight into batch group 14 with `FUN_1414f5090`. It
    never reaches `BSBatchRenderer::RegisterPass`. The accumulator's `+0x160` is 0, so no mask is written.
-   **The Lighting property's passes** (`0x1414afd50`, which Skylighting replaces): one Utility pass, technique
    `0x201A` (`0x2002` with model-space normals), `+1` with vertex colours, `+0x80` alpha-tested, `+0x8000000` for LOD
    objects, pass enum technique + `0x2B`. It needs `kZBufferWrite`, and it rejects skinned geometry, refraction,
    the terrain flags (multi-texture, `kNoLODLandBlend`, LOD landscape), eye reflection, tree animation, decals and
    flag bit 53. No fade, alpha-blend or `kCastShadows` test.
-   **Skylighting's replacement** (`Skylighting.cpp`, `GetPrecipitationOcclusionMapRenderPassesImpl`): a
    `RenderDepth` pass with `Vc`, `Texture` and `AlphaTest`, `LodObject` and `TreeAnim` as the property has them, for
    geometry with `kZBufferWrite` and a world-bound radius above 32. In its own view (`inOcclusion`) it keeps terrain
    and skinned trees, and drops references whose fade node's BSX flags mark them a ragdoll, editor marker, dynamic,
    addon, needing transform updates, magic particles, lights or breakable. Its camera's frustum covers one quarter
    of the square each frame (`SetViewFrustum`, `frameCount % 4`).
-   **`RenderMask`** (`0x140408380`): the camera into the renderer state, target 10 bound and cleared, then
    `FUN_1414a90f0(camera, accumulator, 0)`: the accumulator's `FinishAccumulatingPreResolveDepth` (vfunc `0x2A`),
    whose mode `0x1C` draw function (`FUN_1414b4750`) renders batch group 14. At that hook: render flags 0, viewport
    512x512, depth range [0, 1], `posAdjust` at the occlusion camera.
-   **Who reads them:** the rain particles read the precipitation map; Skylighting's `Prepass` compute (the probe
    update) reads `texOcclusion`.
-   **The cull mode is per pass:** the Utility shader sets it for each draw (0 for a two-sided property, 1 otherwise),
    so the renderer's state at the view's `FinishAccumulating` is the last pass's, and with nothing registered, whatever
    came before. DCLF's variant of the map takes back-face culling as the view's state.
-   **DCLF's variant** draws Skylighting's map itself when both run, and `SetupMask` is skipped
    (`drawcall-limit-fix.md`, "Skylighting's occlusion map, drawn by DCLF").

## The primary's cull: the scene lists

-   **The lists.** `DAT_14338c870` points at `DAT_14338c868` (6) `BSTArray<NiPointer<NiAVObject>>`, one per list job, filled
    round robin by `DrawWorld_BuildSceneLists` (`0x14064bc20`) with reference roots (the children of the cell category
    nodes 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7+; land, water and multibounds; in portal interiors, whole rooms), and `ObjectLODRoot`'s first
    two children whole. Every actor hangs under `ObjectLODRoot`'s second child, which is one entry. `DAT_14338c888` is an
    extra list only the first job culls (sky, weather, the LOD roots).
-   **The order in `CalculateAndDrawShadowCasterLights`** (`0x1414cbb90`): the sun's full-frustum cull
    (`FUN_141511f30(light, &DAT_14338c870, ...)`, the same lists), `FUN_1414a0840`, one job per list
    (`ListAccumulationJob`, `FirstListAccumulationJob` for list 0), `CalculateActiveShadowCasterLights` (the sun's
    `Accumulate` runs here, alongside the jobs), then `JobList::Finish` (`0x1414cbf4d`). Each job culls its list with its
    own `BSGeometryListCullingProcess` (`DAT_14338c8a0[i]`, `cameraRelatedUpdates` and `updateAccumulateFlag` set); the
    list's first entry goes through `Process2` (`0xB8`), which sets the frustum up, the rest through `Process1`.
-   **The registration** (`FUN_1414cbff0`) queues two jobs that walk every list process's output: the depth prepass's
    accumulator (`*0x14338c828`, render mode 0xC) and the main one (`*0x14338c830`, render mode 0, `+0x160` = `0xFFFF`).
-   **`BSFadeNode::OnVisible`** (`0x141479f50`), for a process with `cameraRelatedUpdates`: nothing but the recursion
    when fades are off (`0x142032dfd`) or the node is settled (flags bit 15 with `fadeAmount` (`+0x100`) and
    `currentFade` (`+0x130`) at 1, which no node at Riverwood was). Otherwise `FUN_14147a160(node, fadeAmount,
    {camera position, lodAdjust (+0x184)})` and the last-visible stamp (`+0x13C` = `0x142032e50`); for LOD type 6
    (`+0x153 & 0xF`) with `0x14332a254 == 0x141769578`, its own short step instead. It recurses into the children only
    while `currentFade > 0` and `fadeAmount != 0`. `BSLeafAnimNode::OnVisible` (`0x14147c9c0`) first runs
    `FUN_14147b110` and `FUN_14147a430` (the leaf LOD) when `0x142032dfc` is set; `BSTreeNode::OnVisible`
    (`0x14147d3c0`) also skips the node under a height test.
-   **`GetRenderPasses`' sun bits** (`0x1414adfb0`): ShadowDir is the light selection's output (`FUN_1414fcf80`: the
    incoming flag, and some mask bit naming the sun); DefShadow is the accumulator's deferred flag (`+0x178`) under alpha
    and fade conditions, cleared without ShadowDir or a shadow light; both are cleared for a property with no shadow
    passes unless flags `0x800c000100`. It copies `kSkinned` into descriptor bit 1 and `kProjectedUV` into bit 15.
-   DCLF takes its references out of these lists (`drawcall-limit-fix.md`, "The primary's cull without DCLF's objects").

## The material database: how a material is shared and released

`BSShaderProperty::SetMaterial` (`0x14147bff0`) never stores the material it is given. It asks the material manager
(the singleton pointer at `0x143187758`) for the database's copy, `FUN_1414f7790(manager, material, unique, flag)`:
under the database's spin lock it hashes the material (vfunc `0x20`), walks the bucket and compares with vfunc
`0x18`, and on a miss creates a copy (vfunc `0x08`, `0x10`) and inserts it. It returns the shared material with its
count (`+0x8`, `BSIntrusiveRefCounted`) incremented. The old material goes back through `FUN_1414f7a40(manager,
material)`, which decrements under the same lock and, at zero, takes the material out of the database before deleting
it.

So a reference to a property's material must be dropped through `FUN_1414f7a40`. A `BSTSmartPointer` deletes it
directly at zero and leaves the database pointing at freed memory: the next material that hashes to it crashes in
`FUN_1414f7790` on vfunc `0x18` (DCLF's material cache did this; `drawcall-limit-fix.md`, "The sun's cascades without
DCLF's objects"). Taking a reference is a plain atomic increment, as the engine does in `FUN_1414ac820`.

## Face morphing: the only writer of a face's positions

An NPC's head, mouth, eyes, brows, hair and beard are `BSDynamicTriShape`s under a `BSFaceGenNiNode`. Their
positions are not in a vertex buffer: they are `dynamicData` (`+0x160`), one float4 per vertex (`dataSize` is
exactly `vertexCount * 16`), guarded by a `BSSpinLock` at `+0x168` (lock `FUN_140d38c60`, unlock
`FUN_140d38cc0`). AE 1.6.1170.

-   **The writer.** The job stage "Face morphing" (`Job_Face_morphing`, `0x1406d36b0`, RELOCATION_ID
    38139/39096) is in the "Main post render" stage (`SetupJobLists`, job table `0x142011d60`: Face morphing,
    Sky, Shared particles, Update grass), after the scene and its shadow maps are drawn.
    `impl_Job_Face_morphing` (`0x140432f90`) queues one job per head on job list 12 (`FUN_1404334e0`, which
    calls `FUN_140432550(head, flags & 1)` at `+0x13`), then the stage calls `JobList::Finish`
    (`FUN_140cf6810`, at `0x1406d36fd`). `FUN_140432550` walks the head's direct children (`+0x118` data,
    `+0x122` count): it resets a shape to its base positions (`FUN_14042b4b0` -> `FUN_140d38d70`, without the
    lock), then applies each morph under its own lock and unlock (`FUN_14042fcc0`, `FUN_140430600`). So the
    lock keeps one copy from tearing, not a head: a reader holding it can see a head half morphed.
-   **Which heads.** `BSFaceGenNiNode::UpdateDownwardPass` queues a head (`FUN_1404330c0`, the list at
    `0x14313fa18`, count `0x14313fa28`, a spin flag at `0x14313fa30`) only while its face animates or is near.
    Between jobs the positions do not change.
-   **Everything else reads.** Decals (`1405f0ea0`, `1405f10c0`, `1405ef640`), hit tests (`140e54370`),
    `BSFaceGenBaseMorphExtraData` creation (`140431670`, `1404318c0`), and the draws. Particle geometry
    (`1414c77d0`, `1414c78a0`) is another use of `BSDynamicTriShape`, with its own writer.
-   **The draw.** `FUN_1414f3dc0` / `FUN_1414f4560` copy the whole `dynamicData` under the lock into the
    renderer's dynamic vertex ring (`FUN_140e46d60`: three 4 MB buffers mapped `WRITE_NO_OVERWRITE`, reused once a
    query says the GPU is past them) for every draw of every view, and bind it as stream 1. A skinned shape then
    draws its partitions (`BSDismemberSkinInstance::Unk_25` -> `NiSkinPartition::Unk_25`, `0x140d43a10`) with the
    partition's `buffData` as stream 0 and the ring as stream 1. All partitions of a shape share one vertex
    buffer in the shape's own vertex order (a head: 898 vertices, partitions of 102, 777 and 50 that overlap at
    their seams), so stream 1 is indexed by the same vertex index.
-   **The layout.** A face partition's `vertexDesc` has the position on stream 1 (bit 54) and nothing else
    there; stream 0 holds UV, colour and skinning (stride 20 for a head).
-   **Timing.** Frame N's render draws the morphs of frame N-1's post-render stage.

## Scene state writers: where DCLF takes its events

AE 1.6.1170. These are the choke points `SceneStore::InstallSceneEvents` detours for the delta walk
([dclf-event-driven-tables.md](./dclf-event-driven-tables.md), Phases 2 and 3).

-   **`BSFadeNode::currentFade`** is written in the cull by `BSFadeNode::OnVisible` (vtable slot `0x34`,
    `0x141479f50`): directly for one LOD mode, and through the fade update `FUN_14147a160` otherwise.
    `FUN_1402cff60` calls that update outside a cull.
-   **`BSShaderProperty::SetFlags(flag, set)`** (`0x14147bee0`) sets or clears one bit of the 64-bit flags. It sets
    `lastRenderPassState = 0x7fffffff` when the bit changes, which makes `GetRenderPasses` rebuild the pass list.
    Community Shaders' own in-place flag writes are in `TruePBR`'s `LoadBinary`, before the property is attached.
-   **`BSShaderProperty::SetMaterial(material, unique)`** (`0x14147bff0`) takes the new material from the material
    manager (`FUN_1414f7790`, which shares one instance between properties unless `unique` is set or the property has
    controllers) and releases the old one (`FUN_1414f7a40`).
-   **Controllers.** `NiTimeController::SetTarget` (`0x140d33920`) removes the controller from its old target and
    calls `NiObjectNET::PrependController` (`FUN_140d268d0`): `controller->next = target->controllers`, then
    `target->controllers = controller` (`+0x18`). `NiObjectNET::LinkObject` sets the list directly when a NIF loads.
-   **Havok to the scene.** `FUN_140ea55a0(collisionObject, transform)` writes the node's (`collisionObject+0x10`)
    transform from its rigid body. Its callers:
    -   `bhkCollisionObject::Unk_2B` (`0x140e972c0`, `SetNodeTransformsFromWorldTransform`);
    -   the same slot of `bhkPCollisionObject` and `bhkSPCollisionObject`;
    -   `bhkBlendCollisionObject` (ragdolls);
    -   `FOIslandActivationListener`.

    A keyframed body takes the other branch of `Unk_2B`: `NiAVObject::RecalculateWorldTransform`, since its node
    drives the body. Dynamic clutter that never sleeps calls it every frame, about 10 nodes at Riverwood.
-   **`NiAVObject::SetMotionType`** (`0x140e87270`) runs a subtree visitor (`FUN_140e87df0`, operation 5). On a
    static reference's fixed body it returned true and left the motion `kFixed`.
