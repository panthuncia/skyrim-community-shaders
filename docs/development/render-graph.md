# OpenRenderGraph on DXVK

Community Shaders can run GPU work through [OpenRenderGraph](https://github.com/panthuncia/OpenRenderGraph)
(ORG) on the same Vulkan device that DXVK uses to translate the game's D3D11. Light Limit Fix's clustered
light culling is the first feature that does this. Its D3D11 path stays in place as the fallback.

## Runtime shape

-   **One device.** `RenderGraphRuntime` (`src/RenderGraph/`) has BasicRHI *adopt* DXVK's `VkDevice`
    (`rhi::vulkan::AdoptVulkanDevice`). There is no second device, no shared handles and no cross-API
    fences.
-   **Device features.** Before the game creates its device, `DxvkLoader` calls
    `dxvkRequestDeviceFeatures` to ask for what BasicRHI needs beyond DXVK's own set:
    `VK_EXT_descriptor_heap` and `vulkanMemoryModelDeviceScope` (DXC's atomics use Device scope, and
    DXVK enables `vulkanMemoryModel`). These are enabled on the `VkDevice` only; DXVK's own code keeps
    the feature set it would have chosen, including its descriptor-buffer binding model.
-   **Persistent graph.** A `org::PersistentGraphHost` drives the graph in persistent mode: it is compiled
    once and each frame runs `PrepareFrame` + record + submit. Resizes and pass-set changes rebuild it.
-   **Epoch.** `RenderGraphRuntime::ExecuteEpoch` runs the graph once, on the thread that drives the
    D3D11 immediate context (LLF calls it from `UpdateLights`). CPU data for a frame, such as the light
    list, is uploaded by the graph's own `BUFFER_UPLOAD` path inside the epoch.

## Ordering against D3D11

The graph's batches go into DXVK's own command stream (`dxvkEnqueueInteropSubmission`):

1.  BasicRHI hands each queue submission to the host through `QueueSubmissionHooks::submit` instead of
    calling `vkQueueSubmit`.
2.  The runtime forwards it to DXVK. On the immediate context, DXVK ends its current command list and
    queues the graph's batch right behind it, as an external entry on its submission thread.
3.  So the batch executes after every D3D11 command issued before the epoch and before every one issued
    after it. The render thread waits for nothing: no `FlushRenderingCommands`, no CS-thread sync.
4.  Memory dependencies are covered by the graph's queue-boundary barriers
    (`RenderGraph::SetExternalQueueBoundary`): a full memory barrier at the start of the epoch's first
    command buffer and at the end of its last one.

Submissions from any other thread (none in steady state) first wait until everything already in the
stream has reached the queue, then submit directly under DXVK's queue lock, so the graph's own order
is preserved.

With a DXVK build that lacks the export (or `CS_ORG_SUBMIT=flush`), each epoch instead flushes and
waits for DXVK, then submits under the queue lock. This is undesirable, and will likely be downgraded 
to a failure in the future.

## Resources crossing the boundary

-   **Graph outputs** (LLF's `lightIndexList`, `lightGrid`) are graph-owned buffers. D3D11 reads them
    through wrappers from `dxvkCreateBufferFromVkBuffer`. DXVK never renames, relocates or maps a
    wrapped buffer, and only `D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT` without CPU access is accepted.
-   **Game or DXVK resources** are not pinned or otherwise changed. Inputs the graph needs are either
    uploaded as copies (LLF's light list) or, for future passes, imported each epoch with the handle DXVK
    currently uses.

## Switches

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CS_ORG=0` | No feature request and no graph: every feature stays on D3D11. |
| `CS_ORG=features` | Request the device features but never create the graph (isolates device-configuration side effects). |
| `CS_ORG_SUBMIT=flush` | Use the flush-and-lock submission path even when DXVK supports the stream path. |
| `CS_ORG_LLF_PARITY=1` | Every 300 frames, also run LLF's D3D11 culling and compare each cluster's light set with the graph's (logs `LLF parity OK` / `MISMATCH`). |
| `CS_ORG_EPOCH_STATS=1` | Log render-thread CPU time per epoch (average and maximum every 600 epochs). |

## Building and tests

-   The libraries are submodules under `extern/` (`OpenRenderGraph`, `BasicRHI`, `BasicTelemetry`,
    `volk`); `git submodule update --init` fetches them. `cmake/RenderGraph.cmake` builds them from
    source (Vulkan only) and compiles the SPIR-V at build time with BasicRHI's DXC flags
    (`BasicRHIShaderFlags.cmake`). Set `CS_ORG_ROOT` to another directory with the same side-by-side
    layout to build against local changes to those libraries. If they are missing, the plugin builds
    without the render graph.
-   `tests/OrgDxvkInterop` runs the graph on DXVK's device without the game, in both submission modes
    (`OrgDxvkInteropTest.lock` / `.stream`). D3D11 writes a sentinel before the epoch and reads back
    after it, so either misordering fails the test.
