# Drawcall Limit Fix

Drawcall Limit Fix (DCLF) replaces the game's per-object opaque draw loop with GPU-driven indirect draws
that the render graph executes on DXVK's Vulkan device (see [OpenRenderGraph on DXVK](./render-graph.md)).
It is built in phases:

1.  **Scene capture** (done): CPU tables describing every object DCLF will draw.
2.  **Indirect pipeline** (current): Vulkan device-generated commands, shaders recompiled for the render graph,
    tables uploaded to the GPU.
3.  **Integration and parity**: the native loop skips what DCLF draws; the images must match.
4.  **GPU culling**: two-pass object occlusion culling at the Z-prepass.
5.  **Cutting back the native loop** and its CPU occlusion culling.

What the game binary does, as far as DCLF depends on it, is recorded in
[Skyrim engine notes](./skyrim-engine-notes.md).

## Phase 1: scene capture

Source: `src/Features/DrawcallLimitFix.{h,cpp}` and `src/Features/DrawcallLimitFix/`.

### Which objects

Static rigid geometry:
-   a `BSTriShape` (not dynamic, multi-index or LOD) with no skin;
-   a `BSLightingShaderProperty`;
-   a technique DCLF supports: None, Envmap, Glowmap or Parallax, including TruePBR materials;
-   no alpha blending, no decal flags, no LOD flags, no projected UV and no refraction;
-   not under a `BSOrderedNode`; under an `NiSwitchNode` only while the switch selects it, and part of an actor only with `CS_DCLF_ACTORS` (see "Trees and actors").

Per frame it must also:
-   be visible, meaning not app-culled or hidden up to its tracked root;
-   be fully faded in.

Objects whose LOD fade inputs are undefined in the engine (see `LightingDescriptors.cpp`) stay native. So do
the few objects whose drawn technique cannot be known when the tables are built (`alpha-test-state`, see
the engine notes' batch renderer open question). Anything else stays on the native loop, which draws it as
before.

The reasons are counted per frame (`CS_DCLF_STATS=1`, or the feature's settings page).

### Tracking

`SceneTracker` detours the `NiNode` child functions (`AttachChild`, `DetachChild*`, `SetAt*`). From
whatever thread attaches or detaches, it pushes events onto a lock-free stack. Detach events carry the
geometry leaves collected on that thread while the subtree is intact.

`SceneStore` belongs to the render thread. Every Present (`Feature::Reset`, so also in menus) it:

1.  Refreshes the set of tracked roots. New roots are scanned and removed roots dropped. The roots are:
    -   the Static, Dynamic and MultiBound category nodes of each attached cell (the interior cell, or
        the loaded grid);
    -   the `BSMultiBoundNode` children of `TES::objRoot`, where the engine moves references into
        multibounds (exteriors) and rooms (interiors);
    -   the interior portal graph's rooms and shared node.
2.  Applies the queued events in order.
3.  Re-checks a slice of tracked geometry against its root, as a safety net for missed detaches.

### Tables

At the start of the main pass (`Feature::Prepass`, when `Deferred::StartDeferred` runs), `BuildFrame`
first walks the main-camera accumulator's batches. That yields, for every geometry, the pass the main pass
will draw this frame and the technique it is registered under. It then rebuilds the tables from the
tracked geometry the accumulator holds; the rest of the tracked set was culled by the engine and cannot be
drawn this frame. Phase 5 takes objects out of the accumulator, so it will need the whole set again.

| Table | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `objects` (`ObjectRecord`, 128 bytes, GPU layout) | world and previous world 3×4, world bounding sphere, geometry / material / pipeline indices, flags (alpha test, two-sided, alpha threshold, external emittance suppression) |
| `geometries` (`GeometryRecord`) | the game's vertex and index buffer, vertex description and stride, index count |
| `pipelines` (`PipelineKey`) | final vertex and pixel shader descriptors (as `State::ModifyShaderLookup` produces them for the deferred pass), two-sided, and the raw pass descriptor |
| `geometryConstants` (per pipeline) | the per-frame `PerGeometry` constants for that pass descriptor |
| `techniqueConstants` (per pipeline) | the `PerTechnique` constants (fog, colour output clamp, `VPOSOffset`), sampler filter modes, and the shadow mask binding |
| `permutations` (per pipeline) | Community Shaders' permutation buffer (b4) for the draw |
| `materials` (`MaterialRecord`) | the `PerMaterial` constants, textures, address and filter modes for each (material, pass descriptor) |
| `shading` (`ObjectShading`, 32 bytes) | the per-object `PerGeometry` pixel constants (LOD fades, alpha, emissive colour, SSR specular) |
| `lights` (`ObjectLights`) | Light Limit Fix's per-object `StrictLightData` (b3): room index and shadow mask channels |
| `draws` (`DrawSequence`, 48 bytes) | one indirect draw per object in the device-generated-commands token order, addresses filled in Phase 2 |

The pass descriptor is the accumulated technique: it is what `SetupTechnique` receives. Deriving it from
the property flags is not reliable while the native loop runs, for three reasons:
-   Some bits come from per-frame engine state: the light and shadow assignment, and DoAlphaTest, which
    depends on an early-Z global.
-   `GetRenderPasses` rebuilds a pass only when the light state changes, so the specular and envmap fade
    decisions a pass carries can be older than the current fade metric.
-   The fade values the draw reads are the property fields that same call stored.

`LightingDescriptors.cpp` still derives the descriptor from the flags, following `GetRenderPasses` and
`SetupTechnique` with the LOD fades and TruePBR's changes, because Phase 5 will need it. `CS_DCLF_STATS`
reports how often the derivation disagrees with the drawn technique outside the per-frame bits: in the
coverage runs, at most one object per frame, a specular fade crossing.

Material and geometry constants are not ported. `ConstantEvaluator` runs the engine's own
`BSLightingShader::SetupMaterial` and `SetupGeometry` outside the render loop, against stand-in shader
objects (engine notes: "Evaluating the Setup functions outside the render loop"). The results therefore
include every Community Shaders hook on those functions.
-   **Evaluation frequency:** materials once per (material, pass descriptor) per frame, geometry
    constants once per pipeline per frame.
-   **Per-object values:** World, PreviousWorld, the LOD fades, alpha, emissive colour and SSR specular,
    stored in `objects` and `shading`.
-   **The one port:** `SetupTechnique` binds real shaders, so it is ported (`EvaluateTechnique`) from the
    decompile.

Constant components the engine does not write keep a sentinel (`kUnwrittenBits`). Phase 2 uploads zero for
them. The engine leaves them undefined too; they belong to variables the permutation does not read.

What Community Shaders binds on top of the engine was checked draw by draw (see below):
-   **Per object:** the permutation buffer (b4), Light Limit Fix's `StrictLightData` (b3), and the
    alpha-test reference (b11).
-   **Per pass:** everything else Community Shaders binds for these permutations (b5, b6, b12, and every
    feature texture outside t0–t15). DCLF can bind it once per pass.
-   **Never read by these permutations:** the bone palettes (b9, b10) and Skin's buffers and textures
    (b7, t71, t74, t75).

### Checking it: capture parity

`CS_DCLF_CAPTURE_PARITY=1` compares every native main-pass lighting draw of an object in the tables with
the tables, and logs every 300 frames:

-   `location`: the player's cell.
-   `capture parity OK|MISMATCH` covers (bit for bit, except `EmitColor`, compared within 0.1% because
    time-of-day emittance moves between the table build and the draw):
    -   that the drawn pass is the one the accumulator walk found;
    -   the full pass descriptor, and the final shader descriptors;
    -   the world transform;
    -   `PerMaterial` constants, textures and address modes;
    -   `PerGeometry` constants (with the per-object values applied);
    -   `PerTechnique` constants (re-read at the draw because of the late `VPOSOffset` write), filter
        modes and the shadow mask binding;
    -   tracking misses: eligible geometry under a tracked root that is not tracked.

    Native constants are captured from the Map/Unmap detours, and only components the engine writes are
    compared.
-   `draw parity`: the `DrawIndexed` arguments and the bound index and vertex buffers.
-   `light data parity`: Light Limit Fix's `StrictLightData` (no strict lights in the main pass, room
    index, shadow mask channels).
-   `permutation parity`: the permutation buffer (b4), limited to the extra bits the Lighting shader reads.
    `IsSun` and `GrassSphereNormal` stay set from other shaders' draws.
-   `feature binding parity`: within a frame, every constant buffer b3+ and shader resource outside t0–t15
    must stay the same, and must not be rewritten, across the eligible draws. The exceptions are the
    per-draw buffers listed above.
-   `render state … ->`: the cull, depth, stencil, blend and alpha-test state the native draw used, per
    property-derived key. A key marked `VARIES` means the state is not a function of the key.
-   Diagnostics:
    -   statically eligible geometry drawn outside the tracked roots, with the parent chains of a few;
    -   variables the native shaders have that DCLF leaves unwritten.

Results with `CS_DCLF_TEST_COMMANDS=600:coc WhiterunDragonsreach;1800:coc BleakFallsBarrow01;3000:coc Riverwood`:

| Location | Tracked geometry | Objects in the tables per frame | Checked draws per frame | Table CPU per frame | Mismatches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Whiterun (exterior) | 9,256 | 915 | about 910 | 1.05 ms | 0 |
| Dragonsreach (interior, rooms and portals) | 2,690 | 921 | about 920 | 0.69 ms | 0 |
| Bleak Falls Temple (interior) | 6,442 | about 300 | about 300 | 0.30 ms | 0 |
| Riverwood (exterior, after the cell transition) | 10,078 | 200 to 1,200 (camera moving) | 540 to 1,200 | 0.63 to 1.23 ms | 0 |

Every other check (draw, light data, permutation, feature bindings) is OK in all four.

Community Shaders fixes that came out of it:
-   TruePBR wrote partly initialized constant arrays (`TruePBR.cpp`, now value-initialized).
-   Light Limit Fix's room index and shadow mask derivation moved into `LightLimitFix::GetRoomIndex` /
    `GetShadowBitMask`, shared with DCLF.

## Phase 2: indirect pipeline (done)

DCLF's objects are drawn every frame by the render graph with one indirect command stream per pass, into
off-screen copies of the main pass's targets; the frame itself is unchanged. `CS_DCLF_DEBUG_VIEW=1` copies
those targets over the native ones before the deferred composite, so the frame shows only what DCLF drew.

### Game resources

-   **Buffers and images.** The DXVK fork exports `dxvkGetInteropResourceInfo` (ordinal 135). Given a D3D11
    buffer, texture or shader resource view, it returns the Vulkan handle, offset, size and device address
    (images: create info, view, swizzle and the layout DXVK keeps them in) and marks the resource stable,
    the same lock DXVK's NVX interop uses. Buffers the game can map are rejected. `GpuResources` resolves
    each geometry's vertex and index buffers once and holds a reference while they are cached (Whiterun:
    806 buffers, 0 rejected).
-   **Textures** (`GpuTextures`). DXVK keeps every image it hands out in `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL` and uses
    it between the graph's commands, which is D3D12's simultaneous-access contract. Each shader resource
    view is imported into BasicRHI without ownership, with simultaneous access, and gets a view in ORG's
    shader-visible heap (a slot from ORG's descriptor service, retired against ORG's fences on eviction).
    A null view (the engine binds none) reads zero through a null descriptor, as D3D11's null SRV does.
-   **Samplers** are copies of the renderer's own D3D11 sampler states, the table the engine selects from by
    the shadow state's address and filter modes (engine notes: samplers).
-   **Per-frame constant buffers and dynamic structured buffers** are never locked: `ConstantMirror` keeps
    a CPU copy of each one DCLF watches, fed by the immediate context's `Map`/`Unmap` and
    `UpdateSubresource`, and re-reads mapped buffers from their last mapping (the engine writes some
    constants after `Unmap`). CPU-written structured buffers the pass reads (t98) are copied into graph
    buffers each epoch. Light Limit Fix's lights, light list and light grid (t35-t37) are its graph buffers.

### Pipelines and bindings

Every draw pushes one address, of its binding record (`DrawBindings`, 800 bytes: vertex and pixel constant
buffer addresses for b0-b13, resource heap indices for t0-t127, sampler heap indices for s0-s15). The
pipeline layout maps the shaders' registers onto that record with `VK_EXT_descriptor_heap`'s indirect
mappings; vertices come through the `VertexBuffer` argument. Lighting.hlsl needs no binding changes.

-   **SPIR-V.** `ShaderPrograms` compiles each pipeline key's Lighting VS and PS at run time through
    ORGModuleServices, with the defines of the D3D11 build (`ShaderCache::GetCompileDefines`), HLSL 2018,
    and register shifts per class (`ShaderPrograms.h`). DXC scopes cbuffers declared inside namespaces
    differently from FXC; those members are declared through `Common/NamespacedCBuffer.hlsli` (FXC output
    byte-identical).
-   **Pipelines** (`DrawPipelines`) are built asynchronously through ORGModuleServices' `PipelineService`,
    two per key: the main pass's (color, depth test EQUAL, no depth writes) and DCLF's own Z-prepass (depth
    only, LESS, writes). Vertex input is the engine's input layout for (VS input mask & geometry
    `VertexDesc`), ported from its builder (`VertexInput.cpp`); the pipeline key includes the geometry's
    vertex layout. A pipeline whose shaders read a register the layout cannot map, or a vertex input the
    geometry lacks, fails and its objects stay native. Both variants of a key get the same index in their
    indirect pipeline sets.
-   **Constants** are packed with the native shaders' constant tables (`LightingConstants`, shared with the
    capture parity check): PerTechnique per pipeline, PerMaterial per (material, pipeline), PerGeometry per
    object, Light Limit Fix's StrictLightData per (room, shadow mask), the permutation per (pipeline, object
    flags), the alpha-test reference per threshold, Linear Lighting's `LLPerGeometry` (PS b8, per object;
    Phase 1 missed that it is per draw) per multiplier, and every other bound buffer from its mirror.

### An epoch

At the first lighting draw of the main pass DCLF records what the pass binds; just before the deferred
composite (`Deferred::EndDeferred`) it runs the graph's `MainOpaque` segment. Its callback assembles and
uploads the constants, records, draw inputs and geometry table (about 2.5 ms of render-thread CPU and
1.6 MB for 915 objects in Whiterun). Then:

1.  `BuildDrawsCS` (compute) writes one `DrawSequence` per draw from the inputs and appends it with an
    atomic count, the shape Phase 4's culling will extend.
2.  The main-opaque pass executes the sequences twice with the GPU count: the depth variant into DCLF's own
    D24S8 depth, then the color variant (EQUAL) into eight graph-owned targets with the main pass's formats.
    The render area, viewport and depth range are the main pass's (the engine draws with depth range
    [0, 0.999998]; BasicRHI's `PassBeginInfo` gained the range).

The graph holds every feature's passes and each epoch executes all of them; passes record only in their own
segment (`RenderGraphRuntime::Segment`: LightCulling, MainOpaque, DebugView) and include it in their
invocation revision. An empty pass is effectively free.

### Gate

-   `CS_DCLF_BUILD_PARITY=1`: BuildDraws' output (read back through D3D11 wrappers of the graph buffers)
    equals the CPU templates. OK on every check in Whiterun (915 draws), Dragonsreach (921) and Bleak Falls
    Barrow (about 300).
-   The debug view shows the drawn objects textured, lit and depth-tested; nothing is skipped.
-   No validation errors besides the upstream `vkQueueSubmit2-semaphore-03868`.
-   One ExecuteIndirect per pass (two passes: depth, color) by construction; not yet confirmed in a capture.

### Fixed in shared components on the way

-   **ORG** `PersistentGraphHost` never released upload pages or retired descriptors: every page leaked
    (about 9 GB after a minute of DCLF uploads). It now keeps a per-slot frame timeline, waits for a slot's
    previous frame before reusing it, and calls the upload and descriptor deferred releases.
-   **ORG** persistent execution ignored `commonLayoutOnly` on external textures and transitioned DXVK's
    depth buffer out of GENERAL; `CompileResourceShape` now carries it and compiled states keep layout
    Common. `ExternalTextureResource` also reports the view flags its description implies (persistent graphs
    rejected its depth-stencil views).
-   **BasicRHI**: per-stage descriptor-heap mappings; depth-stencil and packed 10/11-bit formats; images
    imported with simultaneous access (views, attachments and transfers in GENERAL); SRV component mappings
    on Vulkan; null SRVs on both backends (Vulkan: `robustness2` `nullDescriptor`, which the DXVK fork now
    reports); the viewport depth range in `PassBeginInfo`.

### The hybrid path (Phase 3, in progress)

`CS_DCLF_HYBRID=1` makes DCLF draw into the main pass's own targets and depth, and the native loop leave
those objects to it (`DrawcallLimitFix::SkipNativePass`, on the `RenderPassImmediately` call sites Light
Limit Fix hooks, inside the main camera's depth and opaque ranges only). The decision is one frame old,
because the epoch runs after the native passes.

Depth is written in its own segment (`RenderGraphRuntime::Segment::ZPrepass`), at the **end of the native
depth pass**: everything the rest of the frame derives from the depth buffer - the native draws' own EQUAL
test, the sky, Terrain Blending's blended depth and every effect that reads it - has to see DCLF's objects.
The colour pass then runs before the composite and tests EQUAL against it, as the native main pass does.

The two epochs assemble separately, from their own captures, because the depth pass has not bound the main
pass's pixel-stage state yet. They draw the same tables with the same camera, so their depths agree. Only
the colour epoch records what it drew (`drawnFrame`), so the native loop can never skip an object that the
Z-prepass drew but the colour pass then left out - that would leave a hole that writes depth and shows the
background.

Whiterun exterior: 942 objects drawn, 1884 native passes skipped, 2.7 ms of render-thread CPU.

#### The depth-only pipeline variant

Running the Z-prepass inside the native depth pass is only possible because its pixel stage reads nothing
that is not bound yet. Both pipeline variants used to share the full Lighting pixel shader, which reads the
main pass's per-frame constants and textures. The depth variant is now built from its own SPIR-V of
`Lighting.hlsl`, compiled with `DCLF_DEPTH_ONLY`, which returns immediately after the alpha test:

-   alpha testing is a compile-time permutation (`DO_ALPHA_TEST`), so the cut is exact - the alpha-tested
    permutations keep their discard, the rest compile down to nothing;
-   everything past it is dead code, so the compiler drops the per-frame pixel bindings with it;
-   `RegisterUsage` is now kept per variant, so a draw only has to supply what its own variant declares.

The assembly for that epoch therefore skips the pixel-stage per-frame constants, the frame textures at t16
and up, and the structured-buffer copies - all of which come from the main pass's capture - and keeps the
material textures, samplers and vertex-stage constants, which come from the tables.

#### The ghost background, and what depth the rest of the frame reads

Writing the depth at the first draw of the main pass fixed the native draws, the sky and the composite, but
the frame still showed terrain and LOD washed over DCLF's objects. The cause is that the two depth
resources the rest of the frame actually reads are built at the **end of the native depth pass**, before
DCLF has drawn anything:

-   the engine's prepass depth copy (`kPOST_ZPREPASS_COPY`), and
-   with Terrain Blending on, its blended depth - which it also points `kMAIN` and `kPOST_ZPREPASS_COPY`'s
    depth SRVs at for the whole rest of the frame (`TerrainBlending::Hooks::Main_RenderDepth`), so every
    effect reached through `Util::GetCurrentSceneDepthSRV` reads it.

Both therefore held a scene without DCLF's objects, and each depth-reading effect painted the background
over them.

`DrawcallLimitFix::RefreshDepthConsumers`, called straight after the Z-prepass epoch, rebuilds both from
the depth buffer as it now stands: it re-runs `TerrainBlending::BlendPrepassDepths` and re-copies `kMAIN`
into the prepass copy, saving and restoring the render targets around it because the main pass is mid-draw.
That clears the wash completely in Whiterun exterior.

With the Z-prepass now running inside the native depth pass, almost none of that rebuilding is needed:
Terrain Blending builds its blended depth further up the same call site, after DCLF's thunk returns, so it
already sees DCLF's objects. DCLF installs its `Main_RenderDepth` hook before Terrain Blending does, which
is what makes its thunk the inner one of the chain and puts the prepass ahead of the blend.
`RefreshDepthConsumers` is now only the engine's prepass depth copy, and only when Terrain Blending is off
to redirect it - that copy is taken inside the depth pass, before the prepass runs.

#### The Z-prepass must draw exactly what the colour pass draws

Splitting the depth and the colour into two epochs introduced a trap that took a long time to find,
because every symptom pointed somewhere else: DCLF's objects rendered flat and grey, as though unlit.

The cause is an invariant, not a bug in any one pass. The Z-prepass was assembled without the main pass's
pixel-stage bindings, so it could draw objects the colour epoch would later drop for a missing constant.
Such an object ends up with depth in the buffer and nothing to shade it:

-   DCLF's own colour pass skipped it, so it writes no G-buffer;
-   the native loop would have drawn it - it is not in `drawnFrame`, so it is not skipped - but the native
    main pass tests depth EQUAL, and the depth it now finds is the one DCLF computed rather than the one
    the native prepass wrote, so every one of its fragments is rejected too.

Two changes keep the two sets equal:

-   The Z-prepass only draws objects the native loop is actually leaving to DCLF, which is the set the
    colour epoch drew in the frame before - the same rule `SkipNativePass` uses. Anything else keeps its
    native depth, and the native draw that owns it still works.
-   The three per-frame pixel buffers the depth-only shader reads before its alpha test - b5 SharedData,
    b6 FeatureData and b12 the game's PerFrame - are supplied from Community Shaders and from the game's
    own cache rather than from the main pass's bindings or the constant mirror, so the prepass can satisfy
    them during `RenderDepth`. With those in place both epochs assemble the same objects: Whiterun
    exterior and Dragonsreach both report **915 and 921 drawn with nothing skipped**.

Both epochs also rasterise with the main pass's viewport depth range. The game's depth pass and its main
pass do not use the same one - `[0, 0.999968]` against `[0, 0.999998]` - and the range scales the value
written to the buffer, so the same vertex would land about 500 D24 units apart in the two passes.

**How it was found.** By readback, after a long detour of guessing. The instrument that worked copies one
texel of every target, and of the depth, into a buffer from *inside* the epoch, as graph passes ordered
against the draws, and reads that buffer back a few frames later (`CS_DCLF_GBUFFER_PROBE=<x>x<y>`). An
equivalent D3D11 readback issued around the epoch is **not** ordered against ORG's submissions and
silently reports that nothing ever changes; it produced several confident and wrong conclusions before a
control - sampling a pixel only DCLF draws, and seeing no change - exposed it.

### Open
-   The sampler table is read at its AE 1.6.1170 address; other runtimes need its Address Library ID.
-   Material textures are imported per shader resource view; views of one image share nothing yet.
-   Records and constants are rebuilt and uploaded every frame; Phase 4 moves to persistent tables with
    dirty-range uploads.

### Why the indirect draws did not match the native ones

Phase 2 left an open question: testing depth EQUAL against the native Z-prepass rejected nearly every
fragment, and the error grew as objects came nearer. The answer turned out to be neither the arithmetic of
the vertex shaders nor the camera: **the pipelines drew the wrong side of every triangle.**

BasicRHI renders with a y-flipped viewport (it negates the viewport height, as DXVK does for D3D11), which
mirrors the winding of a triangle in framebuffer space. Its `RasterState::frontCCW` was passed straight
through to `VK_FRONT_FACE_*`, so leaving it at its default made the clockwise faces front-facing in flipped
space - the opposite of what the engine's meshes, wound for D3D's "clockwise is front", require. Every
pipeline therefore culled the faces it should have drawn and drew the ones it should have culled.

That single mistake produced all of the symptoms:

-   A flat surface (a floor tile, a wall panel) has no second side, so it disappeared entirely.
-   A closed object still rendered, from its far side, so it looked plausible but sat one object-thickness
    too deep. That is what made the depth comparison look like a systematic scale: along a floor, DCLF's
    view depth was a constant 1.0141 times the native one.
-   Depth EQUAL against the native prepass therefore failed almost everywhere, which is why Phase 2 needed
    a Z-prepass of its own.

The gap was closed in BasicRHI rather than worked around here. `RasterState::frontCCW` is now defined in
clip space - false, the default, is D3D's "clockwise is front"; true is glTF's - and the Vulkan backend
inverts it when it fills `VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo`, so one pipeline description means the
same thing on both backends and no caller branches on the API. DCLF therefore leaves `frontCCW` at its
default, which is already the convention the engine's meshes are wound for.

**How it was measured.** A throwaway depth probe allocated DCLF's depth as a readable texture and compared
it with the native depth on the CPU, with `CS_DCLF_ONLY_ELIGIBLE=1` restricting the native frame to the
objects DCLF also draws, so the two held the same scene and could be compared pixel for pixel. In
Dragonsreach:

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pixels DCLF covers | 2 508 133 | 3 667 129 |
| pixels only the native frame covers | 1 156 228 | 0 |
| pixels equal to the bit | 517 (0.02%) | 1 284 595 (35%) |
| difference, 5th to 95th percentile | +34 to +194 470 D24 units | -3 to +3 D24 units |
| view depth ratio | 1.0073 to 1.0202 | 1.00000 |

The remaining few D24 units are the FXC/DXC difference described below, which is two orders of magnitude
smaller than the bug it was hiding behind.

### The residual: FXC against DXC

The native shaders are compiled by FXC and reach the GPU through DXVK's DXBC path, which marks positions
invariant and keeps `precise` multiply-adds fused; DCLF's are compiled by DXC, which emits NoContraction.
Lighting.hlsl's vertex shader composes `mul(ViewProj, world4x4)` per vertex, whose intermediate terms carry
the object's world position, so the orders differ in the last bits and the perspective divide amplifies the
difference as objects come nearer. It is worth a few D24 units, and no correctness gate should depend on
the two compilers agreeing exactly: DCLF owns the depth of the objects it draws, and the native loop skips
them.

### A gap this left in the checks

Every parity check of Phases 1 and 2 passed while the frame was visibly wrong, because each of them
compares what DCLF *would* submit with what the engine submits: the tables, the constants (276 300 draws,
every block compared), the draw arguments and bound buffers, and the generated sequences. None of them
looked at what the indirect draws actually produced. The depth comparison above is that missing check, and
it is the one that found this. It was a throwaway instrument and has been removed again; Phase 3's image
parity (`CS_DCLF_PARITY`) is its durable form, and `CS_DCLF_ONLY_ELIGIBLE` is what gives it a native frame
holding the same objects.

## Phase 4: what the culling is given to cull

The tables used to be built from Skyrim's main-camera accumulator, which is the engine's output *after* it
has run its own frustum, occlusion-plane and room/portal culling. That made GPU culling impossible to
evaluate: in Whiterun the accumulator held 915 objects out of 9256 tracked, and frustum culling rejected
0 of them. A rejection count of zero reads like a clean pass, but it only meant the engine had already
removed everything the test could have caught.

`SceneStore::BuildFrame` now classifies the whole tracked set, and the engine's decision is kept per object
as `kObjectNativeVisible` rather than thrown away. Two things follow.

**The culling has real work.** The same Whiterun frame offers 3057 candidates, of which frustum culling
rejects 932.

**The engine is the reference oracle.** Because every candidate carries what the engine decided,
BuildDrawsCS cross-tabulates the two for free:

| | GPU keeps | GPU rejects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **engine kept** | drawn | **false negative — a defect** |
| **engine culled** | rescued (expected: the GPU culling is the more conservative of the two until the HZB lands) | agreement |

The false-negative count is the gate. It is reported every 300 frames whether or not `CS_DCLF_STATS` is on,
because an object the engine kept and the culling here dropped is missing from the frame.

### The gate: which candidates may be drawn

`CS_DCLF_CULL_INPUT` decides whether a candidate the engine culled may actually be drawn. It defaults to
`native`, which draws only what the engine kept, so the frame is exactly what it was before while the
counters still measure the whole set. Whiterun, `native`, with frustum culling on:

    culling: 915 draws written, 932 of 3057 tested were rejected (30.5%);
    against the engine: 1210 it culled were gated out, 1210 it culled were kept, 0 it kept were rejected

915 + 932 + 1210 = 3057, and no false negatives. The frame is unchanged and there are no validation errors.

Two hazards came with widening the input, both worth remembering:

-   **Anything that marks an object "drawn" must be gated by what will actually be drawn.** The hybrid skip
    and the Z-prepass both key off `drawnFrame`. Marking a candidate the gate drops would make the native
    loop skip a pass DCLF never drew, and — because the Z-prepass draws exactly what the colour epoch drew
    last frame — would write depth for an object nothing then shades. That is the grey-object failure of
    Phase 3 all over again. The gate is a per-object flag test and so is predictable on the CPU; frustum
    rejection is not, which is precisely what the false-negative counter is for.
-   **Widen the readback with the counters.** The draw-count buffer grew to eight words but its D3D11 view
    was still four, so the two new counters read past its end and came back zero — indistinguishable from a
    clean result. The first run duly reported zero false negatives and zero rescued, and only the arithmetic
    (rescued had to equal the 1210 gated out) gave it away.

### `CS_DCLF_CULL_INPUT=tracked` is not yet correct

Handing the decision to the GPU culling alone works mechanically: 2125 objects draw, nothing is skipped for
missing resources, no buffer overruns, no validation errors. The shading is wrong, in a way that saturates
the frame red — so this mode is a Phase 4/5 target, not a usable setting.

Two known reasons, both structural rather than incidental:

-   Objects outside the accumulator never went through the engine's per-frame light and shadow assignment,
    so their pass descriptors come from the property derivation alone, with its guesses for
    `kRuntimePassBits`, and their `shadowBitMask` is zero. Making that derivation authoritative is Phase 5's
    stated prerequisite.
-   The colour pass tests depth `EQUAL`, and the Z-prepass draws only what the colour epoch drew last frame.
    An object the engine culled has depth from neither pass, so DCLF does not own its depth in the way the
    main pass requires.

The CPU cost of the wider input is also real and unaddressed: building bindings for 3057 candidates instead
of 915 takes 8.4 ms per frame against 3.2 ms. The culling has to move ahead of the per-object binding build
before this set size is affordable.

### The HZB and occlusion culling

`CS_DCLF_CULL=occlusion` adds a hierarchical-depth test after the frustum test. The pyramid is built by
`HzbCS.hlsl` in a pass at the end of the ZPrepass segment, which is the end of the native depth pass, so it
describes the depth the frame actually has: the native occluders the engine drew, plus DCLF's own depth
draws.

Decisions worth keeping:

-   **It stores raw NDC depth, not linear view depth.** Skyrim's projection is monotonic in distance and
    the test only ever compares two depths for order, so linearising would add a step that can be got wrong
    without making any comparison more correct.
-   **Every level is the maximum of the level below**, so a texel holds the farthest surface under it, and
    a footprint that is partly empty sky keeps a large value and nothing under it is culled. Texels outside
    the rendered area read the far plane for the same reason.
-   **Mip 0 is half the next power of two** of the depth, so the chain is a clean sequence of halvings and a
    level can be chosen from a screen extent by `log2` alone.
-   **The whole chain is one pass** with a full memory barrier between dispatches. Levels of one texture are
    not separate resources to the graph, so a pass per level would declare the same resource as its own
    input and output.
-   **A margin on the comparison.** The object's nearest corner is in raw clip space while the HZB holds
    what was stored, which the viewport depth range scaled — and the native depth pass and DCLF do not use
    the same range (`[0, 0.999968]` against `[0, 0.999998]`). The gap is small but systematically in the
    direction that culls, and it bites hardest on flat objects lying against the surface behind them.

Dragonsreach, with the whole tracked set as input:

    culling: 825 draws written, 865 of 1962 tested were rejected (44.1%: 181 outside the frustum,
    684 occluded, 96 of those the engine had kept); against the engine: 0 it kept the frustum test rejected

One validation VUID (the upstream semaphore one), and the frame is pixel-identical to a frustum-only
control run of the same scene.

#### The engine is not an oracle for occlusion

The cross-tabulation against the engine is a real instrument for the **frustum** test, where the engine is
exact and the two must agree — it holds at zero disagreement in both Whiterun and Dragonsreach. It is
**not** one for occlusion, and reading it that way cost a detour here.

The first occlusion runs reported dozens of "false negatives": objects the engine kept that the HZB
rejected. Recording one rejection in full rather than guessing at the count settled it in a single run:

    HZB rejection sample: farthest 0.997283 against nearest 0.998389, uv (0.4537 0.1599)-(0.4573 0.1624),
    mip 3, engine kept it

Those depths are w ≈ 5434 and w ≈ 9066, so the object was some 3600 units behind its occluder. It was
genuinely hidden. The engine's occlusion is planes, boxes and room/portal visibility, all of which keep
plenty of geometry that is in fact invisible — which is the whole reason for testing against a depth
pyramid. An object the engine kept and the HZB rejected is the expected win, not a defect. The counters now
keep the two apart, and whether such a rejection was correct is a question about visibility that only a
depth test can answer, not one the engine's opinion can settle.

#### Getting there: two wrong HZBs first

Both failures looked like plausible culling results and neither was:

-   **The depth was imported twice**, once for the draws to attach and once for the build to sample. The
    graph then saw two resources it believed unrelated, ordered nothing between them and inserted no
    barrier. One import carrying both a depth-stencil and a shader-resource view fixes it.
-   **The UVs were never scaled for the power-of-two padding.** The HZB covers a larger, power-of-two area
    than the rendered image, so a texture coordinate in the image is not one in the HZB. Without the scale
    the culling sampled mostly padding, which is all far plane, and the HZB looked uniformly empty however
    correctly it had been built.

What found both was a counter, not a screenshot: the number of sampled footprints whose farthest depth came
back `~0` or `~1`. 918 of 927 all-far says "this pyramid is empty" in one run, and no amount of staring at
a frame says that. The same counters are still there, and so is the one recorded rejection.

#### Still open in Phase 4

-   **The false-negative detector** (`CS_DCLF_CULL_VALIDATE`) is not built. It is the real gate: draw every
    culled object against the final depth with `LESS_EQUAL`, no writes and early-fragment tests, and flag
    any object that would have produced a fragment. Until it exists, "no objects were wrongly culled" rests
    on frame comparisons, which is weaker than the plan asks for.
-   **The two-phase replay** is not built. Today occlusion culling decides once, in the colour epoch,
    against the HZB built earlier in the same frame; there is no phase-1 list tested against the previous
    frame's HZB and no second depth draw to rescue its rejects. The consequence is that an object that
    becomes visible is drawn a frame late rather than rescued within the frame.
-   **Rigorous image parity** needs a scene that is not clipped. The Dragonsreach comparison is
    pixel-identical by eye, but the frame after a `coc` teleport is so overexposed that per-pixel deltas
    there measure the clipping, not the geometry.

## Phase 4.5 Step 0 and Step 1: the derivation, and what the stand-in leaks

### Step 0: the derivation counter now says what it measures

The counter that reports the property-only derivation against the accumulated pass descriptor used to be
masked with `& ~kRuntimePassBits`, so `0 differ` covered the 25 property bits and silently excluded the
four runtime groups (shadow light count 6-8, ShadowDir 13, DefShadow 14, DoAlphaTest 20) - which are
exactly the bits `GetRenderPasses` produces, and exactly the ones a Phase 5 that stops calling it would
have to derive. It also counted every object in the tables, although an object outside the accumulator has
no pass to compare against: `descriptors.pass` *is* the derivation for those, so they compared the
derivation with itself and could never differ.

Both are fixed. The report is now two halves plus a per-bit breakdown, over the comparable objects only.
Whiterun exterior, 3057 tracked:

```
derivation (last frame): 915 objects compared, 0 would stay native;
  property bits: 0 differ (00000000);
  runtime bits: 602 differ (00006000);
  per bit (* = runtime): bit 13*=602, bit 14*=602
```

The result is better than expected, and it changes what Step 6 costs:

-   The property half is exact: **0 of 915** differ.
-   The shadow light count (bits 6-8) and DoAlphaTest (bit 20) are **already derived correctly** - they
    never appear in the breakdown.
-   The whole gap is ShadowDir and DefShadow, always together, on about two thirds of the objects.

So skipping `GetRenderPasses` is one binary decision away, not four. Withholding registration (Step 5)
remains the right first move regardless, because it does not depend on deriving anything.

### Step 1: the artifact was a shared per-pipeline table, not a leak

**A reproduction that is not subtle.** The artifact was first seen as slightly blown-out additive lighting
in a night exterior, which is a poor instrument: the difference is small, and the time of day and weather
drift between runs. `coc WhiterunBanneredMare` at hour 22 is the opposite - a lit interior where the
defect covers the entire frame in white and red and cannot be mistaken for anything else. Every result
below is from that scene against a `CS_DCLF=0` control taken the same way.

**Two things that made every earlier comparison worthless.** `CS_DCLF=0` was read by nothing: it appeared
in the startup summary line and in no other code, so the feature installed unconditionally and every run
previously labelled a "`CS_DCLF=0` baseline" had DCLF fully enabled. And `CS_DCLF_TEST_COMMANDS` was
driven off `SceneStore`'s frame number inside `Prepass`, which does not run when the feature is off, so a
control never executed the commands and never reached the same cell at the same hour. Both are fixed: the
switch is a real gate, and the command driver has its own counter driven from `Reset`, ahead of the
install check, skipping loading-screen frames so the two runs stay in step.

**The cause.** Several tables are per-*pipeline*, not per-object, and the object that first creates a
pipeline fixes their contents for every object that shares it. The important one is
`tables.geometryConstants`, which comes from `FindLightingPass(property)` of that first object and carries
**that object's scene light list**, from which the engine reads the sun and the per-frame lighting.

While the tables held only the accumulator's output this was harmless: every candidate was visible, in the
lighting situation being drawn. Widening them to the whole tracked set made it a defect. A candidate the
engine had culled - in another room, or unlit - would often create the pipeline and hand its lights to the
visible objects drawn on it. In an interior that is a whole room lit by the wrong light list.

The fix is ordering, in `SceneStore::BuildFrame`: objects the engine kept are classified first, the rest
afterwards. An object the engine kept is by definition in the lighting situation being drawn, so it is the
correct template, and objects that cannot be drawn should never displace it. It costs one extra pass over
a hash map.

**How it was found, and two wrong turns worth recording.**

`CS_DCLF_EVAL` (new) suppresses parts of the stand-in evaluation. The first table it produced looked
decisive and was not:

| Configuration | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `CS_DCLF_TABLES=accumulated` | clean |
| `CS_DCLF_TABLES=tracked` | whole frame blown out |
| `… CS_DCLF_EVAL=off` | clean |
| `… CS_DCLF_EVAL=geometry` (only `SetupGeometry`) | clean |
| `… CS_DCLF_EVAL=material` (only `SetupMaterial`) | blown out |

This was read as "the per-material stand-in leaks state into the engine", on the further argument that the
corruption covered actors, which are skinned and never in DCLF's coverage. **Both halves were wrong.**
Suppressing the material evaluation makes `EvaluateMaterial` fail, which makes its objects ineligible, so
DCLF draws almost nothing - the "clean" rows were clean because nothing was drawn, not because nothing
leaked. And the actors were not corrupted; they were being washed out by the over-bright surfaces around
them.

The control that settled it was one that had never been run: **wide tables and the full evaluation, with
`CS_DCLF_HYBRID` off** so DCLF still builds and evaluates everything but its output never reaches the
frame. That frame is clean, which rules out leaked engine state entirely and puts the fault in DCLF's own
draws. The draw counts said the rest: `tracked` and `accumulated` draw the same ~300 objects in that
scene, so the difference had to be in what the shared tables contained, not in what was drawn.

The lesson is that a switch which suppresses a computation also suppresses everything downstream of it,
so "suppress it and see" only localises a fault when the downstream effects are held constant. The
`HYBRID`-off control does hold them constant, and should have come first.

### The rest of Step 1: evaluations that were pure waste

A candidate the engine culled cannot be drawn while the draws are gated on the engine's own visibility
(`CS_DCLF_CULL_INPUT=native`). It is still kept in the tables so the GPU culling has it as a candidate and
can be measured, but everything downstream of being drawn was being computed for it anyway - the
material's stand-in evaluation and the pipeline's per-frame constants, which are the two most expensive
things in `BuildFrame`.

Skipping those for undrawable candidates, in Whiterun exterior at night:

| | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Material evaluations per frame | 636 | **132** (1783 skipped) |
| Material evaluation cost | 0.39 ms | **0.237 ms** |

The parallel per-object arrays are all still appended for a skipped candidate, with its material and
pipeline indices left at zero - nothing reads them, because `kObjectNativeVisible` is unset and
`BuildDrawsCS` rejects it first. That is what the earlier attempt at this got wrong: skipping one of the
arrays shifts every later object's index.

**The cross-frame material cache is not worth building, and the measurement says so.**
`CS_DCLF_MATERIAL_CACHE=probe` keeps the previous frame's record per (material, pass descriptor) and
compares it with a fresh evaluation. It reports **131 unchanged against 1 changed** per frame, so a cache
would hit about 99% - the worry that `SetupMaterial` reads enough per-frame engine state to make caching
unsound turns out to be wrong in practice.

But it would now save only the remaining 0.237 ms, against classification at 2.450 ms and the indirect
epoch at roughly 3 ms twice over. It also cannot be made exactly safe: the one record that does change
each frame is evidence that something outside the material's own fields feeds the result, so any cache
needs either a validity token that provably covers it or bounded-staleness re-evaluation, and neither is
worth it at this size. The probe switch stays so the decision can be revisited if the balance changes.

### `CS_DCLF_EVAL=audit`, and making `RunStandIn` transparent

Before the control above, the leak hypothesis was tested properly rather than by eye.
`CS_DCLF_EVAL=audit` snapshots the pipeline state around every stand-in call - VS and PS constant buffers,
PS shader resources 0-127, VS shader resources, PS samplers, and the bytes of the `BSLightingShader`
object - and reports every slot that differs after the restore, once per distinct finding.

The first version audited only the first 8 of roughly 640 material evaluations a frame and reported
nothing, which says nothing at all when the leaking call could be any of the other 630. Audited across
every call, it still reported nothing on the material path: the stand-in genuinely leaks no pipeline
state, which is what finally broke the wrong hypothesis.

It did find one real leak, on the geometry path: a stand-in `SetupGeometry` left a constant buffer bound
at PS slot 7 that was not bound before, because a feature hook binds its own per-geometry buffer there and
`RunStandIn` only restored the one slot matching the level being evaluated. That assumption is now gone -
all 14 constant buffer slots are saved and restored on both stages, which removes the class of problem
rather than the instance. The audit now reports zero leaks over a full run.

Light Limit Fix's `BSLightingShader_SetupGeometry_After` was a second real defect found on the way. It
publishes `strictLightDataCB` conditionally, keyed on four cache variables recording what the buffer
already holds, and binds b3 through a once-per-frame latch. A stand-in call updated all of it, so the next
real draw whose lights matched the cache skipped its own upload and shaded with the stand-in's lights.
`ConstantEvaluator::Evaluating()` - which already existed, documented as "hooks on the shader functions
must ignore it", and was consulted by nothing - now guards it.

Neither of these was the artifact. Both are fixed, and `RunStandIn` is transparent by the audit's measure.

**Result.** `CS_DCLF_TABLES=tracked` now matches a `CS_DCLF=0` control in the Bannered Mare at hour 22
with DCLF drawing 953 of 1102 objects, and the audit reports no leaks. `accumulated` is no longer needed
as a fallback.

### Two crashes and a false trail

`SceneStore::ProcessEvents` walked the scene graph every Present, including while a load screen was up,
and a load rebuilds `TES::objRoot` and the cell 3D under it. That crashed twice in the same subsystem: in
`RefreshCategoryNodes`' `objRoot` walk on a child that read back as `0x0001000000020001`, and the day
before in `AddSubtree`. The walks are now skipped while a load screen is up, the queued events are drained
but discarded, and the first frame afterwards rebuilds the tracked set from scratch. `BuildFrame` also
returns empty tables during a load: the tracked entries hold `NiPointer`s to the objects but not to their
renderer data, so classifying them across a load reads freed `BSGraphics::TriShape` data.

A `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` then appeared on `coc` teleports and was chased through five builds on the
assumption that it was one of these changes. It was not: the tree that failed four runs in a row passed
six times afterwards while byte-identical, so the bisect proved nothing and the fault was a persistent GPU
context left by the earlier crash. Worth remembering before bisecting an intermittent fault again - the
control has to be re-run at the end, not only at the start.

## Step 2: the per-draw epoch cost

The indirect epoch assembles one `DrawBindings` record per draw and runs twice a frame, for the depth
pass and the colour pass. The plan assumed the 128-iteration texture loop was the expensive part. It was
not, and the first thing built here was the instrument that says so: `CS_DCLF_STATS` now breaks the epoch
down by part. Bannered Mare at hour 22, 959 draws:

| Part | Before | After | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Textures and samplers | 0.286 ms | 0.258 ms | resolved per (material, pipeline) |
| **Constant groups** | **1.613 ms** | **0.538 ms** | packed per pipeline, patched per object |
| Binding record | 0.089 ms | 0.073 ms | |
| Rest (uploads, the epoch itself) | 0.710 ms | 0.773 ms | untouched |
| **Total per epoch** | **2.74 ms** | **1.62 ms** | 2.85 → 1.91 µs per draw |

### Textures and samplers, resolved once per (material, pipeline)

Neither loop depends on anything per-object: they read the material's textures, the pipeline's technique
(for the shadow mask) and its register usage, plus the frame's shared textures. Running them per draw
meant 128 + 16 iterations and a descriptor heap lookup each for every draw, when about 150 distinct
(material, pipeline) pairs stand behind ~950 of them. They are now resolved on first use and copied
afterwards, exactly as the constant blocks already were.

This is the CPU half of the plan's step 2a. The other half - having the shader read
`ResourceDescriptorHeap[…]` so the indices need not travel in the record at all - is not done, and on this
measurement is worth less than it looked: the loops were 10% of the epoch, not the bulk of it.

### The PerGeometry group: pack per pipeline, patch per object

This was the real cost. `PackConstantGroup` walks every variable in the layout and every component of
each, checking a written-sentinel and copying four bytes at a time; it ran twice per object, over a group
that is identical for every object on a pipeline apart from **five variables** - the two world matrices
and three shading values (`MaterialData`, `EmitColor`, and the w of `SSRParams`).

The group is now packed once per pipeline into a template, and each object copies the template and
rewrites only those five, at byte offsets resolved once per pipeline (`GeometryPatchOffsetsOf` /
`PatchObjectGeometry` in `LightingConstants.cpp`). An unwritten component still packs as zero, which is
what the full pack's initial `memset` produced for it.

It also removes the `GeometryConstants` struct copy per object - two `ConstantBlock`s, about 2 KB - which
`ObjectGeometryConstants` made only to patch four fields in it. That function stays, because the capture
parity check uses it as the reference implementation.

**Validated by capture parity, not by eye.** With `CS_DCLF_HYBRID` off so the native loop still draws
everything and the check has something to compare against: **125,100 draws checked, 0 mismatched (0
material, 0 per-geometry, 0 technique)**. That is a much stronger statement than a screenshot, and it is
the right gate for a change that only ever alters constant *values*.

### A crash this introduced, and the shape of it

Skipping the material and pipeline entries for undrawable candidates left their `materialIndex` and
`pipelineIndex` meaningless, and the first version left them at zero. The first frame after a teleport has
tracked geometry but nothing accumulated yet, so *every* candidate is undrawable, the pipeline table is
empty, and `pipelineBlocks[0]` is out of bounds - an access violation on `coc`. Index zero is not a safe
placeholder when the table can be empty. There is now an explicit `kObjectNoBindings` flag, checked before
anything indexes the tables with those fields, and such objects are reported under their own skip reason
(`candidate-only`) rather than being conflated with pipelines that are not ready yet.

### What is left of step 2

The record is still 800 bytes and still uploaded per draw; `rest` (uploads and the epoch) is now the
largest single part at about 0.8 ms. Cutting it means the bindless work proper - the shader reading its
textures and per-object constants out of GPU-resident tables indexed by a single object index, so
`DrawBindings` and the `IndirectAddress`/`IndirectIndex` ranges disappear. That is a pipeline layout and
`Lighting.hlsl` change (a `DCLF_BINDLESS` permutation beside `DCLF_DEPTH_ONLY`), and it is not started.

## Step 3: both epochs now share a table generation

The Z-prepass epoch runs at the end of `Main_RenderDepth` and `BuildFrame` ran at `Prepass`, from
`StartDeferred`, which is after it. So the depth segment read the **previous** frame's tables while the
colour segment read the current ones, and the per-object visibility verdicts the depth segment writes
could not be applied by index in the colour segment at all - object index *i* meant a different object in
each. That is what blocked two-pass culling.

### The measurement that was wrong, and the one that settled it

An earlier probe counted the accumulated passes at each candidate hook point and found 0 before the depth
pass against 604 at `Prepass`, and this was written up as "`BuildFrame` cannot run any earlier". **That was
wrong**, and the Ghidra decompilation is what exposed it:

-   `Main::Draw` (`0x1406444b0`) queues `DrawWorld_BuildSceneLists` (`0x14064bc20`) on the
    `gJobList_SceneListAccumCulling` job list and **`JobList__Finish`es it before**
    `NiCamera::CalculateAndDrawShadowCasterLights`, i.e. before the shadow maps and long before the depth
    pass.
-   `BSShaderAccumulator::FinishAccumulating` (`0x1414b2240`) is `FinishAccumulatingPreResolveDepth` then
    `FinishAccumulatingPostResolveDepth`; for the main render mode the first of those (`FUN_1414b2d90`)
    **draws** the accumulated passes, over ranges of technique ids, reading the early-Z global at
    `0x14328cc79`. It does not assemble anything.

So the accumulator is complete early, and `globals::game::currentAccumulator` is a *currently rendering*
pointer that is simply not set yet. Re-probing against the accumulator latched from a frame where the
global was set:

| Hook point | via latched accumulator | via `currentAccumulator` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EarlyPrepass` (before the depth pass) | **612** | 0 |
| end of `Main_RenderDepth` | **612** | 0 |
| `Prepass` | 612 | 612 |

The passes were there the whole time.

### What was done

`BuildFrame` and the pipeline/program build move to `EarlyPrepass`, which runs from
`Main_RenderShadowMaps`. `CollectAccumulatedPasses` reads `SceneStore::latchedAccumulator`, refreshed by
`LatchAccumulator()` from `Prepass` where `currentAccumulator` is valid; a change of accumulator is logged
once. The first frame has no latch and builds empty tables, which is harmless.

`DrewLastFrame`'s one-frame tolerance absorbs the shift in when the frame counter advances, so the hybrid
skip needed no change.

### Two things that had to move back, and what caught them

Capture parity caught both; neither was visible in a screenshot.

1.  **`EyePosition` (VS PerGeometry variable 2): 134,700 mismatches of 157,800.** Most of what
    `SetupGeometry` writes is per frame, and `EyePosition` is relative to `posAdjust`. At `EarlyPrepass`
    the renderer's shadow state still belongs to the shadow-map camera just drawn, so the evaluation
    produced that camera's eye (113.07) where the main pass writes 0.
2.  **`EmitColor` (PS PerGeometry variable 8): 6-21 mismatches.** Candle and chandelier emissives flicker,
    and sampling `emissiveMult` at `EarlyPrepass` put it far enough from the draw that the parity check's
    0.1% relative tolerance on `EmitColor` no longer covered the difference (0.49074 against 0.49183, and
    1.2350 against 1.2546).

`SceneStore::RefreshFrameConstants()`, called from `Prepass`, re-evaluates the per-pipeline per-frame
constants and resamples the per-object shading against the main camera's state. To do that it needs the
property whose lighting pass supplied each pipeline's constants, so `tables.geometryTemplate` is kept
parallel to `tables.pipelines`. The object, geometry and material tables are camera- and
time-independent and stay in `BuildFrame`.

The Z-prepass epoch runs between the two and so uses the previous frame's values for those constants.
That is harmless: vertex position comes from `World`, which is patched per object at epoch time with that
epoch's own eye, and never from these.

**Gate:** capture parity **OK, 254,698 draws checked, 0 mismatched**; `CS_DCLF_BUILD_PARITY` OK on 959
sequences; the two epochs now report consecutive table generations (colour 5764, then the next frame's
z-prepass 5765) where they used to report the same one; no crashes, no device loss, 0 VUIDs.

## The object index reaches the shaders

Groundwork for the bindless step, landed and verified on its own.

`DrawSequence` now carries the object's index in `SceneStore::Tables::objects` as a third root constant
word, beside the two that already hold the `DrawBindings` address. The record grows from 64 to 68 bytes;
the push constant range and the `Constant` indirect argument both go from 2 words to 3, and because the
command signature's arguments are positional the vertex buffer, index buffer and draw arguments shift with
it.

Nothing reads it yet. It is the piece the shader needs in order to fetch per-object data from a
GPU-resident table instead of receiving it through a per-draw constant buffer, and it is what makes the
rest of the bindless work possible:

-   Of the PerGeometry group, only **five variables are per-object** - `World`, `PreviousWorld`,
    `MaterialData`, `EmitColor` and the w of `SSRParams` (this is the same finding the Step 2 template
    rests on). Everything else is per-pipeline.
-   Once the shader reads those five from a structured buffer indexed by this word, the PerGeometry
    cbuffer becomes *per-pipeline*, so the per-object arena allocations and packing disappear entirely.
-   With no per-object constant addresses left in it, `DrawBindings` becomes identical for every draw
    sharing a (material, pipeline) pair, so the records deduplicate and the per-draw upload collapses.

That last point is the one that matters for culling: the reason the whole tracked set cannot be handed to
the GPU today is that the CPU builds a binding record per candidate. When records are per-(material,
pipeline), feeding every candidate costs nothing per candidate, and the culling genuinely happens before
any per-draw work exists.

**Gate:** `CS_DCLF_BUILD_PARITY` reports 337 sequences matching the CPU templates byte for byte with the
new 68-byte layout, and the frame is unchanged. Only 21 sites in `Lighting.hlsl` reference those five
variables, so the shader change is small.

## Static ownership: capture at registration, then withhold

DCLF was a guest in the engine's per-frame loop. It now owns a set of objects outright: their passes are
built, lit and shadowed exactly as before, and then kept out of the main camera's batch renderer so the
native loop has nothing to draw.

### Capture belongs at `BSBatchRenderer::RegisterPass`, not at `GetRenderPasses`

The plan called for hooking `BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderPasses` (vfunc 0x2A). That cannot work:
the two fields the tables depend on do not exist when it returns. `AccumulatedPass::technique` is the
batch group's key, which the *caller* computes and hands to registration - it differs from the pass's own
`passEnum` because DoAlphaTest is added there - and `subPass` is chosen inside registration.

`BSBatchRenderer::RegisterPass(BSRenderPass*, std::uint32_t techniqueID)` (vfunc **0x02**, CommonLib
declares it) is the right place. It receives the technique as an argument, and it is also where
withholding belongs: not calling the original is exactly "the batch renderer never receives this pass".

`subPass` is derived rather than observed. The engine's classifier (`FUN_1414f4790`, called from
`RegisterPass` at `0x1414f2a20`) reads **only** the shader property's flags and the geometry's alpha
property: flag bit 54 alone puts a pass in list 4, otherwise the list is bit 36 as value 2, plus whether
`NiAlphaProperty::alphaFlags` bit 9 (alpha testing) is set. Nothing per-frame enters it, which is what
lets DCLF keep the field once passes stop reaching a batch renderer at all.

**Gate:** 634 registrations captured, 634 compared against the accumulator walk, **0 missing, 0 extra, 0
technique differs, 0 subPass differs**. The derivation matches the engine on every pass. The tables are
now built from the capture (`CS_DCLF_PASS_SOURCE=accumulator` restores the walk), and capture parity
stayed OK over 157,800 draws through the switch-over.

Incidentally, registration turns out to be **single-threaded** in practice, despite running under a job
list and despite the engine's classifier taking a mutex. The capture buffer is lock-free anyway, and
reports the thread count so a change would be noticed.

### Withholding

`CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=static`. The hook consults an immutable claim set, published whole once per frame and
read from whatever thread registers; a claim is a standing statement that DCLF owns an object, not the
per-frame decision the old `drawnFrame` skip was.

The claim is **what the colour epoch actually drew**, not what DCLF would like to draw. Withholding means
the native loop will not draw it either, so claiming something DCLF then fails to draw - a pipeline still
compiling, a texture not resolved - leaves a hole. Having drawn it once is the evidence that it can be
drawn again. Claims are dropped across a load screen, because they name geometry from the cell being torn
down.

Only the main camera's batch renderers are affected; the shadow cameras keep their passes. The native
**depth** pass is also untouched, because it registers through a different virtual
(`BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderDepthPass`, `0x1414aff30`) into a different renderer - so DCLF's
existing hybrid depth skip still does that half.

### The hole detector, and what it caught

Per frame on the CPU, with no readback: an object that was **withheld and not drawn** is a hole.

Being claimed is not sufficient on its own, and the first version got this wrong - it counted every
claimed object that went undrawn, which over-reported badly at cell transitions (6, then 14 "holes"). An
object the engine culled this frame is never registered, so it is never withheld either, and nobody was
going to draw it. The test for "the engine would have drawn it" is that its pass was captured this frame.

**Gate:** Bannered Mare, then `coc` to Whiterun, then to Dragonsreach - 921 passes withheld in steady
state, **0 claimed but not drawn** at every report including across all three transitions; no crashes, no
device loss, 0 VUIDs; the native opaque pass now has nothing left to skip (`0 in the opaque pass`).

### What this unblocks

The Phase 4 defect was that the native loop had already skipped an object by the time the depth segment
ran, so anything phase 1 rejected got no native draw, no DCLF depth and therefore no DCLF colour. With
ownership there is no skip decision to get wrong: the engine never draws a claimed object, so DCLF
culling one is simply correct. The Z-prepass no longer gates on `DrewLastFrame` under static ownership.

## Two-pass culling, switched back on

`CS_DCLF_CULL` had been unset since Phase 4, because a culling verdict could not mean anything while the
native loop decided ownership a frame late. With the table generations aligned (Step 3) and the engine no
longer drawing what DCLF owns (static ownership), it runs.

### Results

Dragonsreach, `CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=static`, `CS_DCLF_CULL=occlusion`:

- 1949 candidates tested, 835 rejected (42.8%): 159 outside the frustum, **676 occluded**.
- **158 of the occluded were objects the engine had kept** - the win the HZB exists for, since the
  engine's occlusion is planes, boxes and portals.
- Phase 2 brought back **75** objects the stale HZB had rejected and drew depth for 23 of them, so the
  two-phase rescue is doing its job.
- HZB: 1795 footprints sampled, 0 all-near, 264 all-far.
- **0 claimed but not drawn**, 0 VUIDs, no crashes.

Whiterun exterior, occlusion against a frustum-only control at the same place and hour:

| | Draws written | Rejected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frustum only | 337 | 162 frustum |
| Occlusion | **232** | 162 frustum + 250 occluded (210 the engine had kept) |

A 31% cut in DCLF's draws, and the two frames are equivalent - nothing is missing from the occluded one.

### Why claiming on "drawn last frame" does not fight the culling

There was a real worry here: claims are published from `drawnFrame`, so if culling an object stopped it
being drawn, the claim would lapse, the pass would stop being withheld, and the engine would simply draw
it again - correct output, no saving.

It does not happen, and the measurement says so rather than the argument. `claim churn: +0 -0` in steady
state with occlusion on. The reason is that `drawnFrame` records what the **CPU submitted**, not what the
GPU rasterised: the epoch loop marks every object it builds a record for, and culling happens afterwards
in `BuildDrawsCS`. So an occluded object stays owned and simply is not rasterised, which is what should
happen. The churn counters stay in the stats as a guard, since the property is not obvious from the code.

The same distinction is what keeps the hole detector meaningful: it reports objects DCLF failed to submit,
not objects it deliberately culled.

## Step C: the per-object constants leave the constant buffer

The five PerGeometry variables that differ between the objects of one pipeline - `World`,
`PreviousWorld`, `MaterialData`, `EmitColor` and the w of `SSRParams` - now come from a GPU-resident
table indexed by the object index the draw already carried, instead of from a constant buffer packed per
draw. Built behind `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS=1`, default off.

### How the shader reaches its own index

The draw's push data was already three words: the binding record's address, which the pipeline layout
consumes to resolve the draw's buffers and descriptors, and the object's table index, which nothing read.
It turns out no new binding kind is needed to read it.

BasicRHI's descriptor-heap path gives every push constant range a `VkDescriptorSetAndBindingMappingEXT`
of its own, sourced from `VK_DESCRIPTOR_MAPPING_SOURCE_PUSH_DATA_EXT` at the range's `set` and `binding`
(`rhi_vulkan.cpp`, the loop over `layout.pushConstantRanges`). The `set`/`binding` fields are documented
in `rhi.h` as "ignored on Vulkan", which is true of the classic path and not of this one. So a shader
that declares an ordinary `cbuffer` at the range's register reads push data directly:

```hlsl
cbuffer DCLFPushData : register(b190)
{
	uint2 DCLFRecordAddress : packoffset(c0.x);  // consumed by the layout, not read here
	uint DCLFObjectIndex : packoffset(c0.z);
};
```

The object table itself rides the existing `DrawBindings::textures` mechanism at t127, so it needs no new
binding kind either. The one layout change is a vertex-stage range for that single register - the pixel
stage already had the whole t range, and the vertex half needs exactly one SRV. `ResourceDescriptorHeap[]`
was not needed after all, so the spike the plan reserved for it is not owed.

### The record

```hlsl
struct DCLFObjectRecord
{
	float4 World[3];          // row_major float3x4, already relative to the eye
	float4 PreviousWorld[3];
	float4 MaterialData;
	float4 EmitColor;         // emissive in xyz, the per-object w of SSRParams in w
};
```

128 bytes, and its second half is `ObjectShading` unchanged, which is what lets it be copied straight
through. The five names are reintroduced as `static` globals initialised from the table, so the 21 sites
that read them are untouched; `SSRParams` stays in the constant buffer, because only its w is per-object
and it is read at exactly one site.

`BuildObjectRecord` fills a record from the same inputs `PatchObjectGeometry` writes into a packed group,
through the same unwritten-component rule, and the table is filled for **every** candidate rather than
only the drawn ones - a candidate skipped by the epoch still reaches the culling, and an index that
addressed nothing would be worse than one that addresses a record no draw reads.

### The gate is a CPU comparison, not a screenshot

`CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_PARITY=1` compares each record against the constant group the non-bindless path packs
for the same object, component by component and bit for bit - a tolerance here would only hide a layout
mistake. It needs no readback and does not need both forms in one run, which matters because the
permutations are compiled against the switch and the two cannot coexist in one process.

**It held:** 0 of ~500 million components differ, across the Bannered Mare at hour 22 and the Whiterun
exterior. The frame is correct, static ownership reports 0 claimed-but-undrawn, and the culling still
reports 0 false negatives.

The second half of that gate is structural rather than counted: under `DCLF_BINDLESS` the vertex stage
stops declaring the PerGeometry buffer at all - SPIR-V binding 2 is simply absent from the module - so a
frame with objects in the right places is proof that the transforms came from the table.

### Then the buffer becomes per-pipeline

With nothing per-object left in the group, the objects of a pipeline share one pair of arena blocks
written once, and the per-object allocate/copy/patch disappears. Bannered Mare, per epoch:

| Part | Per-object buffer | Per-pipeline buffer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Textures and samplers | 0.82 µs/draw | 0.25 µs/draw |
| **Constant groups** | **0.82 µs/draw** | **0.33 µs/draw** |
| Binding record | 0.09 µs/draw | 0.08 µs/draw |
| **Total per draw** | **1.96 µs** | **1.47 µs** |

Upload fell from 1.8 MB to 1.1 MB an epoch, and that is *after* adding the object table, which costs 128
bytes per candidate and lands in `rest` at no measurable change (0.76 ms against 0.77 ms).

What remains of `constant groups` is the material, light, permutation and alpha blocks, which were
already deduplicated and are not what this step was aimed at.

A measurement trap worth recording: with `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_PARITY=1` the epoch still reported 0.85 ms of
constant groups, because the check repacks the group per object inside the timed region. The switch is a
gate, not a thing to measure through.

### What is left: deduplicating the binding record

The plan's third item - `DrawBindings` becoming identical for every draw sharing a (material, pipeline)
pair, so the records deduplicate and the per-draw upload collapses - is **not** reached yet, and the
reason is specific. Two entries of the record still vary per object:

-   the light block, keyed on (room index, shadow bit mask);
-   the alpha threshold block.

Both are constant buffer addresses, so the record differs whenever those differ. Moving them into the
object table is the remaining work, and it is a larger change than this one because the room index and
shadow mask are read by Light Limit Fix's own `StrictLightData`, not by `Lighting.hlsl` alone.

## Step D: the binding record deduplicates

The 800-byte `DrawBindings` record was assembled and uploaded once per draw. It is now one per
(material, pipeline) pair: **1616 candidates in Dragonsreach build from 105 records**, and the epoch's
upload falls from 0.9 MB to 0.5 MB. Behind `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW=1`, which implies `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS`.

### Four blocks varied per object, not the two previously recorded

| Register | Keyed on | Where it is read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PS b3 | `(roomIndex, shadowBitMask)` | `LightLimitFix::IsLightIgnored`, one call site in `Lighting.hlsl` |
| PS b11 | alpha threshold | one site |
| PS b8 | emissive multiplier | `Color::EmitColor`, one site |
| VS/PS b4 | `(pipeline, extra)` | - |

Three of those turned out cheaper than they looked:

-   **The permutation block's per-object variation is dead.** The only per-object bit DCLF puts in it is
    `SuppressExternalEmittance`, and that bit is read at exactly one place in the whole shader tree,
    `Effect.hlsl`'s `GetLightingColor` - never by `Lighting.hlsl` or anything it includes. So the block
    keys on the pipeline alone with no shader change at all. The non-bindless build keeps the bit, so
    capture parity goes on comparing the real thing against the engine.
-   **The 1216-byte light block was 16 useful bytes.** DCLF writes `{0, roomIndex, shadowBitMask, 0}` and
    nothing else, so `NumStrictLights` is 0 and the `StrictLights[15]` tail is never read. With the two
    live values moved, b3 is one zeroed block for the whole epoch.
-   **The `NSCB_ALIAS` shim made the b3 move nearly free.** `RoomIndex` and `ShadowBitMask` already
    resolve through `static const` aliases under DXC, so two alias lines become statics reading the object
    record. The cbuffer keeps its declaration and its layout, and Effect, Particle, Water and RunGrass -
    which include the same header and never define the macro - are untouched.

The record grew from 128 to 144 bytes to carry the four values. They went in a row of their own rather
than the spare `ObjectShading::materialData[3]`: that struct is shared with `ObjectGeometryConstants` and
`PatchObjectGeometry`, so anything parked there would leak into the non-bindless build's `MaterialData.w`
and into the parity comparison of that group.

`Lighting.hlsl`'s `DCLF_BINDLESS` block moved into `Common/DCLFObjects.hlsli`, because `Color.hlsli`
consumes the emissive multiplier and is included before the point where the block used to sit.

### Three defects this uncovered, all pre-existing

The capacity check `if (records.size() >= kMaxDraws)` was doing four jobs, and two of the others were
already wrong:

-   **`inputs` could overrun.** The depth epoch's cull-only push happened *before* that check, so the
    input count was bounded by the tracked-set size rather than by the buffer. Past 16384 tracked objects
    the upload would write beyond it and BuildDraws would dispatch over inputs never uploaded.
-   **`visibility` was indexed out of bounds**, by table index into a buffer sized for draws.
-   An object past the record table's capacity still got a draw, whose object index read zeros - a world
    matrix of zeros collapses it to a point at the eye with no other sign.

Both buffers are now sized by the table, and the caps are explicit and separate: object index against the
table, inputs against their own buffer, sequences against the draw cap, records against their own with a
`record-capacity` skip reason of their own.

Two more would have made the validation lie rather than fail:

-   **`CS_DCLF_BUILD_PARITY` sorted both sides by `bindingsAddress`.** Once records are shared that is not
    a total order, and equal-key runs land in arbitrary relative order on the two sides. It now sorts by
    object index, which is unique per sequence. While fixing it, a second limitation showed up: the check
    compared position by position, so with culling on it reported every sequence past the first culled
    object as differing. What the GPU writes is a *subset* of the CPU's templates, so it is now a
    subsequence check - and works for the first time on the configuration DCLF actually ships.
-   **The upload guard covered three buffers with one condition.** A depth epoch where every candidate is
    cull-only has no records and plenty of inputs, and BuildDraws would then run over a stale buffer.

### A parity check that was itself wrong

`emissiveMult` moved from a per-draw scene-graph dereference in the epoch onto the tables, beside the
shading that `MakeShading` already reads it for. The natural check was the record against a live read of
the property, and it fired: about 100 components in half a billion, always on flickering emissives.

**The check was what was wrong.** The multiplier is animated, and the shader divides it back out of the
emissive colour before re-applying it, so the record's multiplier has to be the *same sample* that
produced that object's `EmitColor` - which is why `MakeShading` now hands both back together. A live read
at epoch time is a strictly later sample, and matching it would have broken the cancellation rather than
proved anything. What is checked instead is the plumbing: `emissiveMult` is a new parallel array, and a
gap in one of those shifts every later object's index. Whether it is sampled at the right point in the
frame is already covered, and covered better, by capture parity's `EmitColor` comparison against the
engine's own draw.

### Gates

-   **`CS_DCLF_DEDUP_PARITY=1`**, the check that matters: rebuild the record per draw and compare it byte
    for byte against the one its pair holds. **3,981,022 rebuilt records, 0 differ.** This is the only
    check that would catch a fifth per-object dependency nobody had noticed.
-   `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_PARITY` extended to the four new values: clean.
-   `CS_DCLF_BUILD_PARITY` OK with culling on, 825 of 921 sequences matching with 96 rejected.
-   0 claimed-but-undrawn, 0 VUIDs, correct frames in the Bannered Mare, Whiterun exterior and
    Dragonsreach - which between them exercise all three moved registers: alpha-tested banners, emissive
    fires, and portal-strict interior lighting.
-   Offline, before any run: `DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW` removes bindings 8 and 11 from the pixel module and
    keeps 3, which is reflection-level proof the registers really left the shader.

### What it cost and what it bought

Bannered Mare and Dragonsreach, per epoch:

| | Before Step C | After Step C | After Step D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Per draw | 1.96 µs | 1.47 µs | **0.74 µs** |
| Records per epoch | one per draw | one per draw | one per (material, pipeline) |
| Upload | 1.8 MB | 1.1 MB | **0.5 MB** |

Distinct pairs measured 85 to 201 across three areas, so the record buffer is sized at 2048 entries
(1.6 MB) rather than 16384 (13.1 MB) when deduplication is on, and stays at the draw cap when it is not.

**The structural result matters more than the microseconds.** The reason the whole tracked set could not
be handed to the GPU was that the CPU built a binding record per candidate. It no longer does, so feeding
every candidate to the culling now costs a draw input and a sequence - and nothing else.

## Per-object work, Stage 0: the measurement was lying

`BuildFrame`'s cost was reported in four parts, one of which was called "classification" and read 1.272
ms a frame in Dragonsreach. It was the largest single DCLF cost and the obvious next target.

It was not one thing. `PartTimer` is called at the *top* of each iteration, so that bucket accrued
everything since the previous object: both `FindAccumulatedPass` lookups, `ClassifyStatic`,
`ClassifyFrame`, the derivation counters, two `GpuResources::Resolve` calls, three dedup probes, two
transforms, `ExternalEmittance::ShouldSuppress`, `GetRoomIndex`, `MakeShading`, the `objectIndex` insert
and the `DrawSequence` build. Nine things under one label.

The parts are now ten, each measuring one thing, behind `CS_DCLF_PROFILE=1` (default off, so the loop
makes no clock calls in a normal run). Whiterun exterior, 9022 tracked / 2885 eligible:

| Part | ms | | Part | ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **record** | **1.444** | | resolve | 0.199 |
| classify-static | 0.907 | | diagnostics | 0.118 |
| classify-frame | 0.532 | | dedup | 0.051 |
| pass-lookup | 0.395 | | pipeline-eval | 0.045 |
| material-eval | 0.208 | | walk | 0.129 |

**The largest part is not classification.** It is `record` - the object record assembly: transforms,
bounds, flags, emittance, room index, shading and the draw. Classification is second, and its two halves
together (1.439 ms) only just match it.

The two scale differently, which is what matters for coverage:

-   **classification scales with the tracked set** (9022 objects, ~160 ns each). It is paid for every
    object whether or not it is ever drawn - including the 6097 the exterior rejects every frame.
-   **`record` scales with the eligible set** (2885 objects). It is the cost of actually drawing.

So classification is the part that grows as coverage grows, and `record` is the part that grows as
coverage *succeeds*. Both need work; the priority between them was not what it looked like.

One caveat the numbers carry: timing a loop from inside it perturbs it. Profiled, the exterior reads
4.035 ms; unprofiled it is 2.855 ms. The instrument costs 41%, so the parts are upper bounds and only
their ranking should be trusted.

## Stage 1: dead and duplicate work

No caching yet - only removing work that was being done twice or for nobody.

-   **One pass lookup per object, not two.** The ordering pass called `FindAccumulatedPass` to split
    engine-kept objects from culled ones, then the loop called it again for the same object. The pointer
    is now carried in the ordering entry; nothing mutates the map while the loop runs.
-   **One pass map per frame, not three.** `CollectAccumulatedPasses` walked the batch renderers to fill
    `accumulatedPasses`, `CompareCapturedPasses` built a second map of the same size to compare against
    it, and then the first was discarded and refilled from the second. The capture now fills the table
    directly; the walk and the comparison run only under the new `CS_DCLF_PASS_PARITY=1`, or as the
    first-frame fallback. The batch-renderer set the capture hook needs is refreshed separately, since
    that part *is* needed every frame.
-   **`RefreshCategoryNodes` no longer runs every Present.** It rebuilt and diffed the whole category set
    on every frame, with a full linear scan over the tracked map whenever any node had gone, to detect
    something that changes only when a cell attaches or detaches. It now runs when a cheap signature
    changes, when a detach was drained this frame, or on a 30-frame backstop. The signature deliberately
    folds in everything the refresh reads to *find* nodes - the interior cell, the grid cells, each
    cell's loaded data, its cell3D and its child count - because missing a change means geometry attached
    under a new node is never tracked at all.
-   **Frame-globals hoisted out of the loop.** `Util::IsInterior()` was being evaluated per object inside
    `ExternalEmittance::ShouldSuppress`; that function gained an overload taking the answer, so the
    interior test happens once a frame. Same for the two feature-loaded flags.
-   **The derivation counters are computed only when they are reported.** The whole block, including a
    popcount loop, existed to feed one log line that only `CS_DCLF_STATS` prints, and ran per object per
    frame regardless.
-   **Two vectors stopped being reallocated.** The ordering vectors were locals, so a 9000-object
    exterior allocated and freed two ~140 KB buffers every frame; and the engine-kept count was taken in a
    second pass over the finished table rather than as the objects were built.

### One item was dropped, and the reason is the interesting part

The plan called for removing the duplicated `MakeShading` in `BuildFrame`, on the grounds that
`RefreshFrameConstants` overwrites it at Prepass. It does - but **the Z-prepass epoch runs between
them**, and under `DCLF_BINDLESS` it reads `MaterialData` out of the per-object record, which comes from
exactly that write. `Lighting.hlsl` uses `MaterialData.z` for the alpha test at lines 2833 and 2840,
*before* the `DCLF_DEPTH_ONLY` return at 2857. The same argument applies to the duplicated
`EvaluateGeometry`: `RefreshFrameConstants` deliberately keeps `BuildFrame`'s value for a pipeline whose
template has no lighting pass.

Neither is dead. They are the depth epoch's copy, and the plan's "carefully" was warranted.

### Result

| | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whiterun exterior | 2.855 ms | **2.479 ms** |
| Dragonsreach | 1.676 ms | **1.531 ms** |

**Gates:** `CS_DCLF_PASS_PARITY` reports 1127 compared, 0 missing, 0 extra, 0 technique differs, 0
subPass differs (with ownership off - with static ownership the walk sees only what is not withheld, so
921 show as "extra", which is the whole point of capturing at registration instead). Capture parity 0
mismatched over 276,300 draws. Object, geometry, pipeline and material counts identical across three
cells and two transitions; 0 claimed-but-undrawn; 0 VUIDs.

## Stage 2: why the depth pass is not owned, measured

Owning the depth pass would delete `SkipNativePass` and the per-draw `drawnFrame` map. The plan assumed
it was the same mechanism as the opaque pass with a different virtual. It is not, and a probe on
`RegisterPass` says so directly (`CS_DCLF_REGISTER_PROBE=1`, Dragonsreach, per frame):

| Shader type | Registrations | Into a main-camera batch renderer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lighting (6) | 1125 | **1125** |
| Utility (8) | 2396 | **3** |

`BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderDepthPass` builds its pass with **`BSUtilityShader`**, not the
lighting shader, and those passes go into batch renderers that are not the main camera's. Withholding
filters on `mainBatchRenderers`, so it never sees them.

Owning them means telling the main camera's depth renderer apart from the shadow cameras', which is most
of that 2396 - and withholding a shadow camera's pass removes the object from every shadow it casts.
Against that, the measured prize is ~921 hash lookups a frame, on the order of 0.05 ms. **Deferred, with
the evidence recorded rather than the assumption.** The probe stays behind its switch.

## Stage 3: the classification cache is correct, and buys almost nothing

The plan called this "the main event": in the Whiterun exterior 6097 of 9022 tracked objects run a full
classification every frame to produce "no", and are discarded. Caching that verdict should have removed
most of `classify-static`.

It did not.

| | ms |
| --- | --- |
| `classify-static`, no cache | 0.952 |
| `classify-static`, 5959 objects served from the cache | 0.847 |
| Whole table build, exterior | 2.479 -> 2.460 |

About 17 ns saved per cached object, against the ~160 ns the part costs per tracked object. The reason is
that the work being cached was cheaper than it looked: `netimmerse_cast` is a walk up a chain of RTTI
*pointers*, not a string comparison, and most negatives never get that far - `NotTriShape` and `Skinned`
are decided in the first three lines. What remains in `classify-static` is the witness read itself, which
has to happen for every tracked object either way.

### The part that matters more than the code

The negative cache helps objects that are **ineligible**. As coverage grows to new object classes,
objects move from ineligible to eligible - so this cache helps *less* after coverage grows, not more.
That is backwards from the goal it was written for.

What grows with coverage is the other two:

-   **`record`** (1.218 ms, the largest part) - the object record assembly, paid per *eligible* object.
-   the **positive** half of the derivation, which cannot be cached as it stands because its result comes
    from the engine's per-frame render pass.

So the work that makes per-frame cost fall as coverage rises is the record assembly and the positive
path, not the negative verdict. That is a finding about the plan, not about the code, and it is the
reason to record it here.

### What was kept, and why it is narrow

The cache is on `Tracked`, validated by four pointer witnesses (renderer data, shader property, material,
and a one-byte fade state) compared in full every frame. Only four verdicts are cached:
`NotTriShape`, `Skinned`, `NoRendererData` and `NotLightingShader` - the ones that follow from the
geometry's own shape, which is exactly what the pointer witnesses cover.

Everything decided later is deliberately excluded, because its inputs change behind an unchanged pointer:
`AlphaBlend` reads `materialAlpha`, which is animated; and the reasons `DeriveLightingDescriptors`
produces read property *flags*, which Community Shaders' own features set in place. Caching those would
have traded a real correctness surface for the cheapest third of the population. The first version did
cache them, and the restriction is the more defensible code even though it halves an already small win.

**Gate:** `CS_DCLF_CLASSIFY_CACHE=probe` serves the cached verdict *and* recomputes it, comparing the two.
571 recomputed and compared per frame, **0 differ**, across the Bannered Mare, the Whiterun exterior and
Dragonsreach with two transitions; table counts identical; 0 claimed-but-undrawn; 0 VUIDs.

### The fade metric, reduced to one byte

`FadeStateOf` is the reusable part of this stage. The LOD metric feeds the derivation in exactly three
ways - reject on `!isfinite`, clear `kSpecular` past its fade end, clear `kEnvMap` past its - so two bits
and an invalid marker capture the whole camera dependence of the classification. An object with none of
the fade-sensitive flags returns 0 without touching the fade node at all. The fade *floats* the metric
also produces are overwritten from the property by `RefreshFrameConstants` before any draw reads them, so
they are not part of the witness.

## Switches

**Every feature defaults to on, and test runs should leave it that way.** With no switch set, a run exercises
DCLF's full featureset: the asynchronous builds, the delta scene walk, async epochs, every ownership stage. The startup
log says so on one line, `[DCLF] featureset: full`. A run that sets any feature switch to a reducing value logs
`[DCLF] featureset: REDUCED by NAME=value, ...` as a warning instead (`DCLF::ReducedFeatures`). Turn a feature off
only to bisect or to compare, and say so. Diagnostics (probes, parity checks, stats) are not features and don't
count. The async paths were off by default until 2026-09-24, and validating only the synchronous path let two bugs
through: the shadow pipeline map ("Epochs that only submit") and the NPC head drops ("The scene walk starts at
`Main::Draw`").

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CS_DCLF_STATS=1` | Every 300 frames, log how many objects are tracked, why the rest stay native, and the CPU time scene capture takes, plus the GPU time of each render-graph segment and of the passes in it (`[ORG] GPU time from ORG's pass timestamps`; the menu shows the per-segment totals whatever the switch). |
| `CS_DCLF_CAPTURE_PARITY=1` | Compare the tables with the native draws (see above). Costs CPU on every draw. |
| `CS_DCLF_DEBUG_VIEW=1` | Before the deferred composite, copy DCLF's off-screen targets over the native ones: the frame shows only what the indirect draws produced. |
| `CS_DCLF_HYBRID=1` | DCLF draws into the main pass's own targets and depth, and the native loop skips the objects it drew. |
| `CS_DCLF_HYBRID_NOSKIP=1` | With the hybrid path, keep drawing everything natively, so what DCLF fails to draw is still visible. |
| `CS_DCLF_ONLY_ELIGIBLE=1` | The reverse skip: the native frame draws only the objects DCLF draws, so the two can be compared pixel for pixel. |
| `CS_DCLF_CULL=off\|frustum\|occlusion` | How BuildDrawsCS filters the candidates before writing their sequences: nothing, the frustum, or the frustum and then the HZB. |
| `CS_DCLF_CULL_INPUT=native\|tracked` | Which candidates may be drawn: only what the engine's culling kept (the default), or whatever the GPU culling keeps. `tracked` still shades incorrectly (see Phase 4). |
| `CS_DCLF_BUILD_PARITY=1` | Every 300 epochs, read BuildDraws' output back and compare it with the CPU templates (`BuildDraws parity OK/MISMATCH`). |
| `CS_DCLF=0` | Turns the feature off entirely: no hooks, no tables, no draws. Anything else, including unset, leaves it on. The feature list's on/off toggle, by contrast, applies live: off keeps the hooks and the scene tracking but does no frame work (nothing built, drawn, skipped or withheld, claims dropped), and back on resumes at the next frame without a rescan. Unloading the feature (`Feature::loaded`, the remote toggle) does the same. |
| `CS_DCLF_TABLES=tracked\|accumulated` | Whether the tables hold the whole tracked set or only what the engine's accumulator kept. `accumulated` was the fallback while the per-pipeline template defect was open; `tracked` is now correct. |
| `CS_DCLF_EVAL=off\|material\|geometry` | Diagnostic: suppresses parts of the stand-in evaluation. Note that a suppressed evaluation also stops its objects being drawn, so a clean frame under it proves nothing on its own. |
| `CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=static` | Withhold claimed passes from the main camera's batch renderer, so DCLF owns those objects outright. Default off. |
| `CS_DCLF_SHADOWS=1` | The shadow views: DCLF culls and draws the frame's casters into the engine's shadow map slices in one epoch per frame (below, "Shadow views, step two"). Default off. Live toggle in the menu. |
| `CS_DCLF_SHADOW_OWNERSHIP=static` | Withhold the casters DCLF's shadow epoch draws from the shadow views' batch renderers, per render mode. Needs `CS_DCLF_SHADOWS=1`. Default off. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_SUN_SKIP=1` | M1: the sun's registration of a claimed caster writes only its mask ("The sun without the engine's registration"). Needs static shadow ownership. Default on. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_SUN_EXCLUDE=1\|0\|probe` | The entries whose content DCLF draws entirely leave the sun's cascade culls, and DCLF writes their sun bits ("The sun's cascades without DCLF's objects"). Needs `CS_DCLF_SUN_SKIP`. Default on. Live toggle. `probe`: a dry run that compares DCLF's bits with the engine's and counts the casters the exclusion would lose. |
| `CS_DCLF_SUN_TIMING=1` | Diagnostic: times the render thread in the full-frustum cull, `Accumulate` and the sun's registrations. |
| `CS_DCLF_FEEDBACK=1\|0` | The stood-in roots' fade, LOD and tree-clock state comes from the GPU's visibility feedback on the worker, not the list jobs ("Visibility feedback"). Default on. |
| `CS_DCLF_SUN_GPU=1\|0` | Synthetic passes carry the sun's static bits and the GPU tests the cascades per draw ("The sun's bits on the GPU"). Default on. |
| `CS_DCLF_PRIMARY_EXCLUDE=1\|0\|probe` | DCLF's references leave the main camera's cull and registration; DCLF builds their main passes and runs their fade updates ("The primary's cull without DCLF's objects"). Needs `CS_DCLF_SUN_EXCLUDE` and static ownership. Default on. Live toggle. `probe`: nothing is removed; the census of the lists and the synthetic pass against the registered one. |
| `CS_DCLF_SKYLIGHT=1\|0` | With Skylighting loaded, DCLF draws its occlusion map and the engine's `SetupMask` is skipped ("Skylighting's occlusion map, drawn by DCLF"). Needs `CS_DCLF_SHADOWS`. Default on. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_SKYLIGHT_PARITY=1` | Diagnostic: every 120th map is rendered by the engine and by DCLF in the same frame and compared texel by texel, with the occluders only DCLF drew; `CS_DCLF_SKYLIGHT_DUMP_DIR=<dir>` writes maps that differ over 5 % of their texels as 16-bit PGM. |
| `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT=1\|0` | Resident entries: an admitted entry that needs nothing per frame keeps its records patched across frames, drawn whenever the GPU's cull finds them, and its list job returns at once ("Resident entries"). Default on with the visibility feedback and the switch events; read at startup. |
| `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_PARITY=1` | Every 60 frames, each resident record's synthetic pass is built from scratch and compared with its patch, and the record with the patch. |
| `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_DRAWS=1\|0` | The resident records' draw inputs persist across frames at the head of each main segment's input buffer, changed only by SceneStore's change log ("Persistent resident draws"). Default on; read at startup. |
| `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_DRAW_PARITY=1` | Every 60 frames, each resident region entry is written again from the tables and compared, and every resident the region should hold is looked for. |
| `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_PROBATION=1\|0` | Entries not yet admitted join residency out of view, and the build's draws admit them ("Resident entries", step 2). Default on with `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT`; read at startup. |
| `CS_DCLF_SWITCH_EVENTS=1\|0` | An `NiSwitchNode`'s selection follows events: the index's writers are patched, a newly selected child is brought up to date when the event is applied, and neither the scene walk nor the primary's list jobs test switches every frame ("Switch selection by event"). Default on with `CS_DCLF_SCENE_DELTA`; read at startup. |
| `CS_DCLF_SWITCH_NODES=1` | Leaves under an `NiSwitchNode` (trees, harvestables) are eligible in the frames every switch on their path selects them ("Trees and actors"). Default on. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_SKIN_PARTITIONS=1` | Skins of several partitions and dismember skins (LOD trees, actor bodies) are eligible, one draw per partition the engine draws. Needs `CS_DCLF_SKINNED`. Default on. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_ACTORS=1` | Geometry under an actor is eligible, as is the FacegenRGBTint technique. Default on. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_FADING=1` | Objects fading with the screen-door mask in an opaque group are eligible ("Fading objects"). Default on. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_LOD_CROSSFADE=1` | An object in a LOD cross-fade stays DCLF's (its own pass, the new level); only the engine's hint-10 copy of the old level is native ("LOD cross-fades"). Off: the whole object is native until the crossing ends. Default on. Live toggle. |
| `CS_DCLF_TREE_TRACE=1` | Diagnostic: every geometry of a TREE reference followed frame by frame (registered, withheld, accumulated, bindings, native and DCLF draws, and the switch, LOD and transforms before the walk and after the cull), with who drew it, gaps and double draws, every 300 frames. |
| `CS_DCLF_TEST_MOVE=start:end:units` | Test harness: moves the player along their heading by `units` a frame between two frames (several ranges separated by `;`), and runs `tgm` first so the flight is survivable. |
| `CS_DCLF_NATIVE_PROBE=1` | Diagnostic: every 300 frames, the Lighting draws the main pass still issues natively, by form type, DCLF verdict, technique, skin shape and LODMode, with sampled ancestor chains. |
| `CS_DCLF_SHADOW_PROBE=1` | Diagnostic: the shadow probe (step one): per-view engine state, registrations, derivation and rule cross-checks, and the engine's shadow CPU. |
| `CS_DCLF_PASS_SOURCE=accumulator` | Build the tables from the accumulator walk instead of the captured registrations. |
| `CS_DCLF_MATERIAL_CACHE=probe` | Diagnostic: measures how many material records are unchanged from the previous frame, i.e. whether a cross-frame cache could work. |
| `CS_DCLF_EVAL=audit` | Diagnostic: snapshots pipeline state around every stand-in call and reports anything not restored. Very slow; the frame rate collapses. |
| `CS_DCLF_SHADER_DEBUG=1` | Build the Lighting and Utility SPIR-V with source-level debug info (`-Zi`: `OpSource` with every file's text embedded, and `OpLine`), so Nsight and RenderDoc show source for DCLF's draws. Still optimized. Not `-fspv-debug=vulkan`: its `DebugValue`s keep dead loads alive, so stages read resources their passes do not bind and every candidate is skipped; `vulkan-with-source` also fails DXC 1.9's own validator. There is deliberately no `-Od` form either: unoptimized code reads per-frame constant buffers the epochs do not supply (VS b6, PS b7). The Z-prepass stage (`DCLF_DEPTH_ONLY`) compiles the lighting out of `Lighting.hlsl` rather than relying on the optimizer. The debug builds have their own cache keys. The shader files the game sees through MO2's VFS are also copied, keeping their `Data/Shaders/...` layout, to `CS_DCLF_SHADER_SOURCE_DIR` (default `<Documents>\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\CommunityShaders-ShaderSource`). Shaders DXVK translates from DXBC get no source info this way. The build-time SPIR-V (BuildDrawsCS, HzbCS, LLF's cluster shaders) is always built with `-Zi` (`cmake/RenderGraph.cmake`). Dev-Fast builds do not package it: copy `build/Dev-Fast/generated/Shaders/*/ORG/*.spv` into the mod's `Shaders` folder after changing those shaders. |
| `CS_DCLF_TEST_TOGGLE=<off>:<on>` | Test runs: flips the feature's menu toggle off and back on at those frames (loading screens not counted), to exercise the live on/off. |
| `CS_DCLF_TEST_COMMANDS=<frame>:<command>;…` | Test runs: run each console command on the main thread once that many frames have been presented (loading screens do not count), for coverage runs from the auto-loaded save. The counter is independent of the feature, so a `CS_DCLF=0` control reaches the same place at the same hour. |
| `CS_DCLF_ASYNC=off\|on\|probe` | Where the epochs' payloads are built (see "Payloads built off the render thread"). `on` (default since 2026-09-24): the enabled jobs build on the `CS DCLF worker` thread and the epoch commits the result. `off`: inline. `probe`: build on the worker *and* inline, and byte-compare the two payloads (`probe: N compared, N differ`). Bindless path only; the non-bindless path always builds inline. |
| `CS_DCLF_ASYNC_JOBS=colour,zprepass,shadow,scene` | Which jobs `on`/`probe` move to the worker (default: all four). For bisecting. |
| `CS_DCLF_OBJECT_SLOTS=0` | Rebuild the object tables densely every walk instead of keeping each object at a persistent slot ([dclf-event-driven-tables.md](./dclf-event-driven-tables.md), "Phase 1"). Also turns the delta walk off. For A/B. |
| `CS_DCLF_SCENE_DELTA=0` | Walk the whole tracked set every frame (on the worker, with `CS_DCLF_ASYNC`) instead of the delta walk, which evaluates on the render thread only what can have changed ([dclf-event-driven-tables.md](./dclf-event-driven-tables.md), "Phase 2"). For A/B. |
| `CS_DCLF_WALK_PARITY=1` | Every 60 frames, rebuild the tables densely on the render thread, classifying every object from scratch, and compare them with the frame's object by object, along with every entry's classification and per-frame traits (`walk parity ... <- OK` every 5 checks; [dclf-event-driven-tables.md](./dclf-event-driven-tables.md), "Phase 3"). |
| `CS_DCLF_ASYNC_WAIT_MS=<ms>` | How long an epoch waits for its job before building inline instead (default 3). |
| `CS_DCLF_ASYNC_PRIORITY=normal` | Run the worker at normal priority instead of above normal. |
| `CS_GPU_IDLE_TRACE=<frames>` / `CS_PROFILER_LOG=<frames>` | Not DCLF's, but the gates below read them: the GPU idle trace and its `[GpuIdle] summary` lines, and the profiler's averages in the log. See [render-graph.md](render-graph.md). |

### Capture tools and GPU timing

- Every render-graph pass is a `VK_EXT_debug_utils` region named after the pass (`cs.dclf.main-opaque`,
  `cs.dclf.build-draws`, ...), opened before the pass's entry barriers, so a wait on the previous pass
  shows up inside the pass that needed it. Each epoch's submission is also a queue label named after its
  segment (`CS DCLF: main opaque`, ...).
- DCLF's draws are device-generated commands (`vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsEXT` over an indirect
  execution set), not `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect`. Nsight does not time the generated draws as a draw
  of their own, and bills their GPU time to the barrier recorded just before them. The pass timestamps
  are the reference instead. Measured on the auto-loaded save: main opaque 3.08 ms in the draw pass
  against 0.006 ms in BuildDraws' dispatches; Z-prepass 0.49 ms of draws and 0.10 ms of HZB; shadow
  views 1.29 ms of draws. The `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect` calls outside every DCLF region are DXVK's translation of
  Grass Optimizations' D3D11 `DrawIndexedInstancedIndirect` calls.
- The profiling window lists every render-graph pass that did work, from the same timestamps, under its
  feature: `DrawcallLimitFix::<segment> / <pass>`, and `LightLimitFix::RenderGraphCull / <pass>`. No D3D11
  timer brackets an epoch: it would straddle the epoch's submission and count the queue's idle time too
  (see "GPU timing in the profiling window" in [render-graph.md](render-graph.md)).
- RenderDoc (1.46) does not support `VK_EXT_descriptor_heap`. With RenderDoc capture on, the render graph
  cannot start and DCLF is forced off for the session; the log and the feature's menu page say why.

### Defaults

Unset switches now take the configuration every gate run of this work used: `CS_DCLF_HYBRID=1`,
`CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=static`, `CS_DCLF_CULL=occlusion`, `CS_DCLF_SKINNED=1`, `CS_DCLF_TREES=1`,
`CS_DCLF_DECALS=1`, `CS_DCLF_PROJECTED_UV=1`, `CS_DCLF_MTLAND=1`, `CS_DCLF_SWITCH_NODES=1`,
`CS_DCLF_SKIN_PARTITIONS=1`, `CS_DCLF_ACTORS=1`, `CS_DCLF_FADING=1`, `CS_DCLF_LOD_CROSSFADE=1`,
`CS_DCLF_SHADOWS=1` and
`CS_DCLF_SHADOW_OWNERSHIP=static` (the tables already default to the tracked set). An explicit value
overrides a default: `0` for the class and path switches, `off` for the two ownership switches and the
culling. Rows above that say "Default off" describe the switches before this change. All of them are live
toggles in the menu.

## Known upstream issues

Found while building DCLF. None is caused by DCLF; each is recorded here until it is fixed or ruled out.

| Where | Issue | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXVK fork (`extern/dxvk`) | Intermittent validation error `VUID-vkQueueSubmit2-semaphore-03868`: a binary semaphore in a submit's signal list is still signaled. 0 to 5 per run, in the swapchain/present path. It started in this branch's runs; DCLF issues no Vulkan calls. The newest `extern/dxvk` commits include a presenter revert, the suspected cause. | Open, not investigated |
| Community Shaders, Subsurface Scattering | `ExtraShaderDescriptors::IsBeastRace` is set or cleared only in the face/skin `SetupGeometry` path (`SubsurfaceScattering::BSLightingShader_SetupSkin`), but `Lighting.hlsl` writes `!IsBeastRace` into the G-buffer mask (`psout.Masks.y`) for every object. After a beast-race face draw, the static objects drawn next inherit the bit. DCLF uses the intended value (0), so once DCLF draws them, its output can differ from native in that mask channel. | Open; not seen in the coverage runs (no beast-race faces in view) |
| Community Shaders, permutation buffer | `IsSun` and `GrassSphereNormal` stay set in `ExtraShaderDescriptor` from the last sky/grass draw. The Lighting shader does not read them, so this is harmless today, but any shader that starts reading them inherits stale values. | Harmless for now |
| Community Shaders, TruePBR | Constant arrays passed to the shader were only partly initialized (e.g. `ParallaxOccData` zw). | Fixed (`TruePBR.cpp`, value-initialized) |
| Community Shaders, Effects11 | Logs `[E] Required effect file not found: enbseries\enbeffect.fx` on every start without ENB files. | Unrelated noise |
| Skyrim, `BSLightingShader::SetupTechnique` | Writes `VPOSOffset` after unmapping the PerTechnique buffer. It works on DXVK, where dynamic buffers stay mapped. On a native D3D11 driver the write is undefined. | Engine behaviour; DCLF reproduces the value |
| Skyrim, fog constants | `FogFarColor.w` is copied from uninitialized stack memory. | Engine behaviour; the shader does not read it |
| CommonLibSSE-NG | `BSBatchRenderer::renderPass` is declared as `BSTArray<PassGroup*>` but holds `PassGroup` structs inline. | DCLF works around it; not fixed in the library |
| Tooling | The CS deploy step (`*_plugin.stamp`) sometimes fails on its first run and succeeds on the next. Once (`dclf16`) the game recompiled all 3,473 shaders despite logging "Using disk cache"; the cause was not found. | Open, cosmetic |

## Open questions and assumptions (Phase 1)

-   **DoAlphaTest gained after the tables are built.** Resolved: the bit is not a property of the object
    (engine notes, batch renderer), and DCLF now draws every pass in an alpha-test list with it. See
    "Holes on alpha-tested objects" below.
-   **Parentless interior geometry.** About 30 draws per frame in Dragonsreach and Bleak Falls Barrow have
    no parent node; probably the portal graph's `alwaysRenderChildren` or its other object lists. Not
    tracked, so these stay native.
-   **Emissive drift.** `EmitColor` differs from the drawn value by up to about 1e-4 relative on emissive
    windows: the time-of-day emittance moves between the table build and the draw. Where it is updated
    was not traced. Parity compares it within 0.1%.
-   **Shadow mask size.** `VPOSOffset` uses the shadow mask render target's size. The engine uses globals
    at AE `0x14328be9c`. The two were equal at 1920×1080; not checked with a different mask size
    (`iShadowMaskQuarter`) or dynamic resolution.
-   **Early-Z global.** Whether DoAlphaTest is set for alpha-tested geometry depends on which offscreen
    renders ran before (engine notes). Phase 5 must decide how to derive it.
-   **Stand-in side effects.** Evaluation calls `SetupMaterial`/`SetupGeometry` through the vtable, so every
    Community Shaders hook runs. The engine shadow state and CS's permutation data are restored.
    Light Limit Fix's hook uploads its `StrictLightData` for the template pass. It records what it
    uploaded, so its upload cache stays consistent, and the next native draw overwrites it. A hook added
    later that keeps other global state would need the same review.
-   **Template pass for geometry constants.** Per-pipeline `PerGeometry` constants are evaluated with a
    copy of any object's lighting pass (for the sun light). This is valid because everything per object
    is replaced afterwards (engine notes, `SetupGeometry`: what is per object); parity confirms it for the
    main pass only.
-   **Actors.** Resolved: geometry under an actor is eligible with `CS_DCLF_ACTORS` (default on), and the gates hold (see "Trees and actors").
-   **Unwritten constants.** Components the engine never writes are uploaded as zero in Phase 2. The
    engine leaves them undefined, and the permutations do not read them.
-   **SE 1.5.97 and VR.** Only AE 1.6.1170 was tested. DCLF uses two raw offsets, into
    `BSBatchRenderer`'s `renderPassMap` (`+0x2C`, `+0x48`); their SE layout is assumed identical. VR is
    disabled.

## Still open in Phase 1

-   Parentless geometry in interiors (about 30 draws per frame in Dragonsreach and Bleak Falls Barrow)
    stays native; probably the portal graph's always-render lists.
-   The alpha-test-state objects (engine notes, batch renderer open question) stay native.
-   **Cost:** see the results table; tracking adds about 0.05 ms. In Whiterun, 0.54 ms of the 1.05 ms is
    classification and record building (about 1,450 accumulated tracked geometries) and 0.38 ms is the
    stand-in evaluation of 295 materials. Caching materials across frames is the obvious next saving; it
    needs a reference on the material so that a reused address cannot hit a stale entry.
-   Phase 5 cuts the native loop, so the accumulator walk will no longer supply the per-frame technique
    bits. They then have to be derived: the light and shadow assignment (`FUN_1414fcf80`) and the early-Z
    global.

## Stage 4: the per-object loop stops repeating itself

Stage 0 named `record` the largest part of `BuildFrame`. Splitting it showed the label was wrong in the
same way Stage 0's had been. `timer.Add(BuildPart::Dedup)` fired only inside the miss branches of the
three dedup maps, so on the hit path — nearly every object — three hash probes fell through to the next
iteration and were billed to `record`. Whiterun exterior, 3057 objects:

| part | ms |
| --- | --- |
| `record` (the real assembly) | 0.615 |
| `dedup-hit` (the three probes) | 0.396 |
| `loop-tail` (per *tracked* object) | 0.336 |

Half of what `record` reported was not record assembly. The named work was nearly free in that cell
anyway: `GetRoomIndex` early-outs on `roomNodes.empty()` outdoors and `ShouldSuppress` short-circuits on
`!interior`.

**Container churn.** The three dedup maps were locals — three hash maps allocated and freed every frame
to hold the same contents, the waste Stage 1 removed from the ordering vectors and left here. They are
members now, and `objectIndex`, `shading`, `emissiveMult` and `lights` are reserved like the other
per-object containers. The two ordering passes became one: `order` and `culled` were built separately
and then concatenated, up to a ~6000-entry memcpy a frame, purely to guarantee that an engine-kept
object reached a pipeline first.

**The pipeline template is elected, not ordered.** That guarantee is now stated as a rule about the
objects: if a later native-visible object finds a pipeline whose lighting template came from a culled
one, it takes the template over. This survives a table that outlives the frame, which ordering cannot.
The first gate statistic counted *pipelines with a culled template* and read 12 of 31 under
`CS_DCLF_CULL_INPUT=tracked` — a false alarm, because a pipeline drawn only by culled candidates has no
native-visible object to elect and harms nothing. The invariant that matters is the implication, checked
over the finished tables rather than asserted from the election: **if a native-visible object draws on
pipeline p, then `geometryTemplate[p]` came from a native-visible object.** Measured with the election
doing real work — 10 takeovers a frame — it holds at 0, and Dragonsreach lighting is unchanged.

### The material cache, and why the measurement lied twice

The plan called for promoting `materialProbe`, "a 99% hit rate that only needs promoting". It was not.

The probe compared records with `memcmp` over a struct whose members total 2340 bytes while the struct
is 16-aligned, so it was comparing **12 bytes of uninitialised trailing padding**; every comparison came
out unequal. With member-wise equality it still read 104 changed, 0 unchanged — but only the PS block
moved, at three adjacent floats holding the **same value for every material in the frame** (min == max
across all 104) and drifting with the time of day.

`BSLightingShader::SetupMaterial` explains it. In Ghidra it is `BSLightingShader::Func4` at `1414dc310`
— vtable slot 4, named by slot rather than by name. Its tail reads:

```c
if (*(char *)(this + 0xf0) == '\0') { lo = *(this + 0xe0); hi = *(this + 0xe8); }
else                                { lo = *(this + 0xd0); hi = *(this + 0xd8); }
offset = *(byte *)(currentPS + 0x5d);   /* PS constant table[29] */
```

PS PerMaterial **variable 29 is IBLParams** (`ShaderCache.h:50`), and SetupMaterial does not read it
from the material at all: it comes from fields of the BSLightingShader object, selected by a day/night
flag at `this+0xf0`. It is shader-level frame state that happens to live in the per-material group.

> **Superseded** by "Material records from their sources": the frame-global positions are now a fixed
> list from the decompiled SetupMaterial, not learned, and the validator only reports.

So the cache serves the record and patches those positions from a live evaluation. **The positions are
cumulative for the session**, which a failure taught: learning them each frame as "floats that differ
from the cached copy" works only while the value drifts continuously. `set gamehour to 22` steps it once
and then freezes it — the next frame saw no difference, learned an empty set, patched nothing, and
served every material its pre-step value. Capture parity failed on **220,500 of 276,300 draws**, with
IBLParams.y reading 0.757 against a native 0.106.

The values are sampled again at Prepass (`RefreshMaterialPatch`), for the same reason and in the same
place the animated per-object shading is resampled: sampled only at EarlyPrepass they sit a fraction of
a frame behind what the native draws read, visible as IBLParams differing in the sixth decimal across a
fast lighting transition.

The result is that the cache is parity-*better* than evaluating every material, because it fixes a
pre-existing mismatch the uncached path has. Mismatched draws per report interval, same route:

| interval | cache off | cache on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cell change (`coc`) | 253239 | 20572 |
| `set gamehour` step | 248670 | **0** |
| steady state | 0 | **0** |

104 evaluations a frame became **9** — one to learn the patch, eight rolling validations — with 103
served. `material-eval` went 0.443 → 0.106 ms in the exterior and 0.045 in Dragonsreach. It defaults on.

**Two instrument defects, both of the same kind.** The validator's cursor reset every frame, so with a
stable iteration order it re-checked the same eight materials for ever and reported "0 stale" while
capture parity was failing on 80% of draws. And `probe` forced the evaluate path, so it measured a
configuration with no cache in it. Both now follow Stage 3's shape: serve the cached value, recompute
it, compare, and use the served one — a probe that does not exercise the thing it is probing proves
nothing.

### Buffers resolve once per TriShape

Both `GpuResources::Resolve` results were only ever read inside the `newGeometry` branch; for an object
whose geometry was already in the table they were computed and discarded. With ~3.8 objects per TriShape
in the exterior that is most of the calls, and in steady state a Resolve is a hash probe
(`DescribeResource` runs only on first insert).

The call was **moved**, not cached, and the distinction is the safety argument: GpuResources holds a
reference on each buffer so its address cannot be reused, and it drops that reference when an entry goes
`kEvictFrames` without a Resolve. Resolving per TriShape still touches every entry the tables depend on
every frame. Skipping the call outright would have let the eviction sweep drop the reference underneath
live draw arguments, which is the device-loss hazard `BuildFrame` already documents.

`resolve` went 0.326 → 0.176 ms in the exterior, 0.110 → 0.072 in Dragonsreach.

### The property derivation is dead work for an accumulated object

For an object the accumulator holds, `DeriveLightingDescriptors`' derivation block has exactly one
surviving effect: `a_out.derivedPass`. The pass descriptor comes from `a_accumulated->technique`; the
flag edits the block makes to `f` are never read afterwards; the two LOD fades it computes are
overwritten from the property two lines later; and its return value is not consulted to reject the
object. Only the derivation diagnostic reads `derivedPass`.

So for those objects the fade metric, `SelectLightingTechnique`, ten flag tests and a virtual
`GetFeature()` call were being run and thrown away. They are skipped now unless the diagnostic asks for
them, which also moved that diagnostic from `CS_DCLF_STATS` to its own `CS_DCLF_DERIVE_PROBE`: gating it
on the stats switch meant every reporting run measured a configuration nobody ships. The report line is
gated too, because printed unconditionally it read "0 objects compared, 0 differ", which scans as a
passing check rather than one that never ran.

The saving is smaller than it looks — `classify-static` 0.363 → 0.338 ms in Dragonsreach, and nothing
measurable in the Whiterun exterior. The reason is worth recording: in the exterior most candidates are
*not* accumulated (3057 objects, ~915 engine-kept), and for those the derivation **is** the pass
descriptor, so it has to run. The work removed scales with what the engine kept, not with what DCLF
tracks.

What remains in `classify-static` is not computation. A descriptor memo keyed on the pass descriptor was
tried in an earlier stage and measured neutral, and `ModifyShaderLookup` is pure bit manipulation on that
descriptor. The remaining ~300 ns per call is dominated by touching the geometry, property, material,
alpha property and fade node — five separate allocations, each a likely cache miss. Removing it means
not touching them at all, which is a *positive* verdict cache, not a cheaper derivation.

### The RTTI cast is resolved once per property, and that is where classify-static stops

`netimmerse_cast` is cheap in instructions — it walks a chain of RTTI *pointers*, not strings — but every
step is a dependent load into a different allocation. At ~3000 classifications a frame it was the one
part of `ClassifyStatic` that was neither computation a memo could remove nor memory `BuildFrame`
re-reads later anyway. Whether a property is a `BSLightingShaderProperty` follows from its type, so the
property pointer is a complete witness, and `Tracked` now remembers both the pointer and the result
(null included, which is what makes a negative trustworthy).

**RTTI casts walked per frame: 0.** `classify-static` 1.011 → 0.945 ms in the exterior, 0.363 → 0.312 in
Dragonsreach, with the classification probe still at 0 differ and capture parity clean.

That is ~11%, and it is the end of the road for this part. With the casts at zero and the derivation
skipped for accumulated objects, `classify-static` is still 0.945 ms over ~3060 calls — about 310 ns
each — and what remains is memory: the geometry runtime data, the property, the material, the alpha
property and the fade node, five allocations touched per object. A *positive* verdict cache cannot
recover much of it, because its own witnesses must read the geometry, the property and the fade node,
and `BuildFrame` re-reads the alpha property and the material downstream for the two-sided flag, the
alpha test and the material key. What is left is the pointer chasing the data layout implies, not work
that can be cached away.


### Result

**Dragonsreach 1.531 → ~1.31 ms** a frame, unprofiled, over ten steady-state intervals. Gates: capture
parity 0 mismatched over 276,300 draws an interval, classification cache 0 differ, pipeline templates 0
visible objects on a culled template, material cache 0 stale, 0 claimed-but-undrawn, and no VUIDs beyond
the upstream semaphore one.

**Still open.** Caching the *table slots* on `Tracked` — the remaining `dedup-hit`, 0.373 ms — needs the
tables to persist first, because a slot is only worth caching if it is stable. The plan had that
dependency the other way round.

## Stage 5, attribution: the epoch, and a switch that was off

Splitting `BuildFrame` twice had shown the same failure both times — a bucket named after one thing that
mostly contained another. The epoch's four parts had never been split at all, and "rest" was a
subtraction. Splitting it found two things, the second of which matters more than any optimisation in
this document.

### The parts are per record, not per draw

`mark(0..2)` all sit inside `if (!dedup || recordIndex == kNoRecord || dedupParity)`. Since Step D
deduplicated the binding record to one per (material, pipeline) pair, that block runs ~105 times an
epoch rather than ~1500. So "textures/samplers", "constant groups" and "binding record" were per
*record*, while the per-*draw* work — the loop prologue with its `resolvedBindings` probe, and the tail
that builds the sequence and the draw input — was invisible inside "rest", together with the uploads and
the graph execution.

### Step D's deduplication was never switched on

The split's first measurement read `1538 candidates built from 1538 binding records`. `dedup` is
`BindlessDraws()`, which requires `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW`, and that defaults off — so **every
measurement taken since Step D has had its deduplication disabled**, and "constant groups 0.715 ms" was
~465 ns of constant packing per draw rather than per pair.

With the switch on, in Dragonsreach, 1521 candidates collapse to **105 binding records**:

| part | dedup off | dedup on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| textures/samplers | 0.131 | 0.047 |
| constant groups | 0.715 | 0.162 |
| record push | 0.160 | 0.060 |
| per-draw tail | 0.117 | 0.102 |
| per-draw prologue | 0.188 | 0.118 |
| epoch prologue | — | 0.052 |
| graph execute | — | ~0.61 |
| **epoch total** | **~1.98** | **~1.15** |

That is ~1.6 ms a frame across the two epochs, from a feature already written, tested and gated. Its
gates hold: record dedup parity 4.8M rebuilt records matching their pair byte for byte, bindless record
parity 204M components matching the constant groups, no mismatches, no VUIDs beyond the upstream
semaphore one, and Dragonsreach renders identically.

It is **not** defaulted on here, because the standing debt lists a live test matrix — kill cams, the map
menu, first person, water reflections, Dynamic Cubemaps, save and load — that has to be worked through
before any switch flips, and `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW` changes the shader build as well as the CPU path.

### What is left is not per-object

Fully split, with dedup on:

| part | ms | scales with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **graph execute** | **~0.61** | **nothing — fixed per epoch** |
| constant groups | 0.162 | records |
| per-draw prologue | 0.118 | candidates |
| per-draw tail | 0.102 | candidates |
| record push | 0.060 | records |
| textures/samplers | 0.047 | records |
| epoch prologue | 0.052 | nothing |
| uploads | 0.000 | deferred to the graph's upload pass |

Half the epoch is the graph execution and the `PassFrame` build — fixed cost, independent of object
count, and paid twice a frame. The genuinely per-candidate part is the prologue plus the tail: about
**145 ns per candidate per epoch**, not the ~1.2 us a division of the old total implied.

## Stage 5: the transform witness cannot pay for itself

The plan's Stage 5 rested on one idea: most of a Skyrim cell never moves, so a 48-byte transform compare
should skip the record write and the upload for most objects. Stable object slots — a free list, one
array indexed by slot, per-slot frame stamps, every table consumer changed — existed mainly to make that
possible.

Three measurements say it does not work, and none of them needed the slots built.

**The transform stores are 13 ns an object.** `CS_DCLF_TRANSFORM_PROBE=skip` removes both
`StoreTransform` calls outright — it renders wrong, and exists only to bound the cost. In Dragonsreach,
1962 objects: `record` 0.413 → 0.387 ms. That 0.026 ms is the *ceiling* on anything a transform cache
could save. A witness would read two 52-byte `NiTransform`s and copy 48 bytes to avoid 18 multiplies, so
it adds more memory traffic than the arithmetic it removes. It would be a net loss.

**The record build is 26 ns an object.** `BuildObjectRecord` runs for every object before the epoch loop,
and that whole prologue measures 0.052 ms for 1962 objects.

**The upload is already free on the CPU.** `BUFFER_UPLOAD` reaches `UploadService::UploadData`, which
records the pointer and size; the copy happens in the graph's upload pass. The measured "uploads" part is
0.000 ms. The copy is real, but it lands inside `graph execute`, and turning the bindless object table
on and off — 282 KB an epoch — moves `graph execute` by less than run-to-run noise.

So the three things Stage 5 was going to avoid cost 13 ns, 26 ns and approximately nothing. **Stable
object slots are not worth building for this.** They may still be worth building for a different reason —
they would remove the `objectIndex` insert, which `dedup-hit` measures at ~119 ns a draw — but that is a
different argument from the one in the plan, and it should be made on its own evidence.

## The live test matrix for CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW

Driven through `CS_DCLF_TEST_COMMANDS`, with record-dedup and BuildDraws parity on throughout.

| case | how | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| interiors with rooms and portals | `coc WhiterunDragonsreach`, `coc WhiterunBanneredMare` | clean |
| exteriors | Whiterun, `coc Riverwood` | clean |
| cell transitions | six, across both runs | clean |
| worldspace change (fast-travel equivalent) | `coc Riverwood`, `coc Whiterun` | clean |
| night lighting / emissives | `set gamehour to 22` | clean |
| dungeon, alpha-tested foliage, god rays | `coc BleakFallsBarrow01` | clean |
| save | `save dclfm2` | clean |
| **load** | `load dclfm2` | clean — the path that frees renderer data |

Across both runs: **0 mismatches**, 21/21 BuildDraws parity OK, 20/20 record dedup parity OK, 0 rejected
buffers, and no VUIDs beyond the upstream semaphore one. Images correct in Dragonsreach, Bleak Falls
Barrow and Riverwood.

**Not covered, because they need input the console cannot drive:** kill cams, the map menu, first
person, Screenshot and Remote Control. Dynamic Cubemaps is not installed in this profile, so it was not
exercised either. The switch is therefore left **off by default** — the automatable part of the matrix is
clean, but the matrix is not complete, and that last step is a human one.

## CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW defaults on

Validated over the live test matrix and enabled by default, together with `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS` that it
depends on. Both are disabled with `=0`, and `=0` is the control every pre-Step-D measurement in this
document was taken with.

With no switches set, Dragonsreach now builds **85 binding records** from ~1500 candidates and the epoch
costs ~1.02 ms against ~1.98 before. Gates on the default path: 11/11 BuildDraws parity, 11/11 record
dedup parity, 0 mismatches, no VUIDs beyond the upstream semaphore one. The map menu and the
first-person camera were checked by hand; the console-driven part of the matrix (interiors with rooms
and portals, exteriors, six cell transitions, a worldspace change, night lighting, a dungeon with
alpha-tested foliage, save and load) was clean.

## Bringing in a new object class: trees

### Which class, decided by histogram

`Ineligible::Technique` counted 847-1337 objects in the Whiterun exterior with no indication of what was
in it. Recording the rejecting technique gives:

| cell | rejected |
| --- | --- |
| Whiterun exterior | **treeAnim(12) = 1237**, MTLandLODBlend(19) = 96, MTLand(8) = 4 |
| Dragonsreach | refraction(63) = 5 |

One technique is 92% of the class. That is the one to bring in.

**The first version of this histogram read `none(0)=1337` and meant nothing.** `ClassifyStatic` copies
its descriptors to the caller only when the verdict is `None`, so on a rejection the caller kept a
default-initialised `rejectedTechnique` — and 0 is `none`, a *supported* technique. An empty field that
reads as a plausible value is the same failure as the material probe comparing padding and the validator
re-checking a fixed sample. The default is now 62, which cannot be mistaken for a real answer.

### What trees need, measured rather than guessed

`CS_DCLF_TREES=1` adds technique 12 to the supported set. Coverage in the Whiterun exterior goes from
~2900 to **3863 objects**, and `treeAnim` leaves the rejection histogram.

Capture parity then fails, identically with bindless on and off, so it is the trees and not the newly
defaulted switch. The sample list could not say why — it is capped, and the standing `PS PerMaterial 29`
difference filled it, so 83,396 per-geometry mismatches produced not one sample. Counting mismatches
**per variable** instead names them at once:

| variable | mismatches |
| --- | --- |
| **VS PerGeometry 5 — WindTimers** | 83,390 |
| **VS PerGeometry 4 — TreeParams** | 47,851 |
| PS PerMaterial 29 — IBLParams (standing) | 57,300 |

Declaration order in `Lighting.hlsl`'s VS PerGeometry block is World, PreviousWorld, EyePosition,
LandBlendParams, **TreeParams**, **WindTimers**, so 4 and 5 are exactly the two constants tree animation
displaces its vertices with.

This is the defect the switch was put there to catch, and it is the same shape as the culled lighting
template: **DCLF's PerGeometry constants are per PIPELINE**, taken from one template object, while
TreeParams is a property of the individual tree and WindTimers advances during the frame. One template
tree's wind is handed to every other tree sharing its pipeline.

### What finishing it requires

TreeParams and WindTimers have to become per-object values carried in the object record, exactly as Step
C did for World, PreviousWorld and MaterialData: add them to `BindlessObject`, read them per object in
`BuildFrame`, and take them from the record in the shader under `DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW` (and through
`PatchObjectGeometry` otherwise). Where the engine computes TreeParams for a given tree still has to be
established — `BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry` is the place to read it from, the same way IBLParams was
traced to the shader object. `CS_DCLF_TREES` stays off until that lands.

### Where the engine gets TreeParams and WindTimers

`BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry` is vtable slot 6 — `BSLightingShader::Func6` at `1414dd040`. Its
`case 0xc` is technique 12, TreeAnim. The VS constant table base is `0x50` (the PS one is `0x40`, which
`SetupMaterial`'s `0x5d` for variable 29 confirmed), so `0x54` is variable 4, TreeParams, and `0x55` is
variable 5, WindTimers.

The data comes from a **`BSTreeNode`**, reached from the shader property:

```
property->fadeNode                     // BSShaderProperty + 0x60
    ->vfunc[0x1f8 / 8 = 63]()          // downcast; null for anything that is not a tree
```

`BSTreeNode` is a real engine class — it registers by that name alongside `BSFadeNode` in the class
table at `FUN_14147e2c0`. Its wind state:

| offset | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `+0x158` | squared distance (the code takes its square root with the `0x5f3759df` fast inverse square root and one Newton step) |
| `+0x15c` | maximum amplitude |
| `+0x160` | leaf frequency |
| `+0x164` | wind timer |
| `+0x168` | previous wind timer |

and the derivation, with `node` null giving `distance = 0` and `maxAmplitude = 1`:

```
TreeParams.x = 0
TreeParams.y = *(0x142033060 + 0x304)                       // global wind magnitude
TreeParams.z = clamp((1 - (sqrt(node[0x158]) - A) / (B - A)) * maxAmplitude, 0, maxAmplitude)
TreeParams.w = node ? node[0x160] : 1
WindTimers.x = node ? node[0x164] * K : 0
WindTimers.y = node ? node[0x168] * K : 0
```

`A` = `DAT_142033100` and `B` = `DAT_142033104` — a distance fade, written by one function and read by
`BSUtilityShader::SetupGeometry` as well. `K` = `DAT_141ad28bc`, a timer scale.

**SetupGeometry mutates the node.** Its last act in this case is

```c
*(undefined4 *)(lVar22 + 0x168) = *(undefined4 *)(lVar22 + 0x164);   // previousWindTimer = windTimer
```

so the engine advances each tree's animation state as a side effect of setting up its draw. Two
consequences. A per-object *stand-in* evaluation — calling the engine's SetupGeometry once per tree the
way `EvaluateMaterial` does for materials — would advance every tree twice a frame and is therefore not
an option here. And whenever DCLF does own the tree pass outright, it has to perform that write itself,
exactly once, or tree motion stops.

The remaining work is bounded: carry TreeParams and WindTimers per object (a parallel array plus two
more `GeometryPatchOffsets` entries is enough for the non-bindless path, and needs no shader change),
derive them as above, and let capture parity's new per-variable histogram confirm it — a wrong constant
shows up immediately as `VS PerGeometry 4` or `5`, which is what makes replicating engine arithmetic
safe to attempt at all. Only then do the two values need adding to `BindlessObject` and the shader.

### Trees, landed

`CS_DCLF_TREES=1` brings technique 12 into coverage. The Whiterun exterior goes from ~2900 to **3862
objects**, and `treeAnim` leaves the rejection histogram entirely.

TreeParams and WindTimers are carried per object: a `tables.treeAnim` array parallel to `objects`, two
more `GeometryPatchOffsets` entries for the constant-buffer path, and an `ObjectTreeAnim` at the end of
`BindlessObject` (144 -> 176 bytes) with matching `float4`s in the GPU record, since under bindless the
PerGeometry block is one pair for the whole pipeline. `windTimers` is a `float4` using only `xy` so the
two layouts cannot disagree about padding.

Two defects on the way, both caught by the per-variable histogram within one run each.

**The first version wrote zeroes over every object in the frame.** `tables.treeAnim` is filled for all
objects and `PatchObjectGeometry` wrote it unconditionally, so every *non*-tree lost the TreeParams and
WindTimers its pipeline template had supplied. Parity went from 47,851/83,390 mismatches to
126,942/124,505 — worse, and the samples read `DCLF 0, native 1`, which is what a clobber looks like.
Writing them only under a new `kObjectTreeAnim` object flag took WindTimers to **0** and TreeParams to
**600**.

**The last 600 were the square root.** The engine does not call `sqrtf`: it puts the squared distance
through the `0x5f3759df` fast inverse square root with one Newton step and multiplies back by x.
Substituting `std::sqrt` agreed for every tree that clamps at one end of the fade band and disagreed for
exactly the population inside it — 600 draws a frame, 0.7%. Reproducing the approximation bit for bit
closes it.

**Gates.** Constant-buffer path: capture parity **0 per-geometry mismatches** across four intervals,
against a no-trees control on the same build with identical material numbers (57,300 + ~3,000, both
pre-existing). Bindless path: **443M bindless record components matching**, 20/20 record dedup parity,
21/21 BuildDraws parity, 0 mismatches, no new VUIDs, and trees render correctly.

`CS_DCLF_TREES` is left **off by default**: the gates are clean, but it is a large coverage change and
the project's practice is that a switch defaults on only after someone has looked at it moving.

### A correction to earlier measurements in this document

Several "capture parity 0 mismatched" readings above were taken from the *tail* of a run's log, which is
always the cell the run `coc`s into — Dragonsreach. The Whiterun exterior intervals of those same runs
were not clean: 22,228 material mismatches, all `PS PerMaterial 29` (IBLParams).

This is not caused by the material cache, and the cache is not a regression — with the cache **off** the
same exterior reads **297,589**, five times worse, because nothing then resamples IBLParams at Prepass.
The residue is the sub-frame lag already described: outdoors the value moves far more within a frame
than it does inside Dragonsreach, and one sample at Prepass no longer covers it. `VS PerMaterial 11`
(TexcoordOffset, animated per material) contributes a further ~3,000 and is genuinely uncacheable.

The lesson is the same one the instruments keep teaching: **read every interval, not the tail.** A run
that visits two cells reports two different answers.

## BSEffectShader: investigated, and not worth doing

`not-lighting-shader` is the largest rejection class by tracked count — 3057 in the Whiterun exterior
after trees — so it looked like the obvious next coverage target, and the assumption was that it meant
repeating Steps A-D for a second shader. Three measurements say otherwise, and together they redirect
the work.

**What the class actually is.** Recording the rejected property's RTTI rather than just counting:

| cell | property types |
| --- | --- |
| Whiterun exterior | BSEffectShaderProperty 2701, *no property at all* 343, BSWaterShaderProperty 13 |
| Dragonsreach | BSEffectShaderProperty 235, *no property* 1 |

343 of them have no shader property, so nothing could ever draw them.

**Over half is alpha blended.** 1717 blended against 1340 opaque outdoors, and 208 against 28 inside.
Blended geometry is not drawn in the pass DCLF owns: it goes after the deferred composite, forward and
sorted back to front, while the epoch writes the G-buffer with depth test EQUAL before the composite.
Covering it would mean a **new epoch**, not another shader in the existing one.

**And almost none of it is drawn in the main pass anyway.** The `RegisterPass` probe, counted per report
interval (~300 frames) and split by whether the batch renderer belongs to the main camera:

| shader type | into a main renderer / total | per frame |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lighting (6)** | 603,974 / 618,674 | **~2013** |
| **Effect (7)** | 3,900 / 3,900 | **~13** |
| Grass (1) | 3,300 / 6,600 | ~11 |
| Water (3) | 11,700 / 11,700 | ~39 |
| Utility (8) | 0 / 1,537,933 | 0 |

**BSEffectShader registers about thirteen passes a frame.** The 2701 tracked effect objects are
overwhelmingly magic and environment effects that are not currently drawing. A second shader pipeline —
its own stand-in evaluation, constant layout, permutation compilation, pass-capture filter and record
shape — would buy thirteen draws.

### Where the remaining coverage actually is

DCLF claims 1464 of the ~2013 Lighting passes a frame. **The gap is ~549 draws a frame, and all of it is
inside the Lighting shader**, where every piece of machinery already exists. Tracked counts for what is
still rejected in the Whiterun exterior, trees on:

| reason | tracked | what it needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| projected-uv | 860 | the ProjectedUV constants, per object |
| skinned | 633 | the bone palette in the record |
| unsupported-parent | 630 | scene-graph shapes the tracker declines to follow |
| decal | 601 | blending and depth handling |
| not-trishape | 274 | dynamic tri shapes |
| technique (MTLand, MTLandLODBlend) | 100 | terrain, the per-object constant question trees had |

Trees were worth doing because 1237 tracked objects turned into real draws. These are the classes to
rank next, by how many of their tracked objects the engine actually draws — a number the registration
probe can give per class, and the one that should decide the order rather than the tracked count that
made BSEffectShader look like the prize.

## Ranking the remaining coverage by what the engine actually draws

Tracked count is the wrong measure, and ranking by it is what made BSEffectShader look like the prize.
The right one is: of the objects DCLF rejects, how many did the engine itself register a main-pass
lighting draw for this frame? That is `accumulated != nullptr` at the point of rejection, so it costs a
counter and no new machinery.

Whiterun exterior, trees on, per frame:

| reason | tracked | **drawn** | of tracked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **decal** | 601 | **181** | 30% |
| **skinned** | 633 | **150** | 24% |
| projected-uv | 860 | 53 | 6% |
| not-trishape | 274 | 44 | 16% |
| technique (MTLand, MTLandLODBlend) | 100 | 33 | 33% |
| actor | 27 | 21 | 78% |
| unsupported-parent | 630 | 7 | 1% |
| **not-lighting-shader** | **3057** | **0** | **0%** |

Dragonsreach agrees: decal 88 -> 35, skinned 52 -> 30, not-trishape 52 -> 26, not-lighting-shader
51 -> **0**.

The order is almost the reverse of the tracked counts. `projected-uv` led on tracked objects (860) and
is sixth on drawn ones; `unsupported-parent` has 630 tracked and draws seven. And
**not-lighting-shader draws nothing at all** — stronger than the ~13 a frame the registration probe
suggested, and a complete answer on BSEffectShader.

Everything still rejected totals ~490 drawn a frame, against the 1464 DCLF claims.

### Feasibility, which does not follow the same order

DCLF's pipeline expresses exactly one piece of fixed-function state, `kRasterTwoSided`; depth test EQUAL
with no write, and blending and depth bias off, are assumptions baked into every pipeline it builds. The
VS layout gives Bones no real storage. So:

-   **decal (181)** needs depth bias and blending in the `PipelineKey`, and an ordering guarantee
    against the base geometry underneath. Structural.
-   **skinned (150)** needs a bone palette per object — a variable-length array, unlike every per-object
    value the record carries today. Structural.
-   **projected-uv (53)** needs the ProjectedUV constants, and `TextureProj` is **already** VS
    PerGeometry variable 6 in the layout. Plausibly the trees pattern again: derive it per object, patch
    it, gate with capture parity.
-   **technique MTLand / MTLandLODBlend (33)** is terrain, and wants per-object `LandBlendParams` —
    VS PerGeometry variable 3, also already in the layout. The same pattern once more.

So the two largest classes are the two that need new architecture, and the two that fit the existing
machinery are worth ~86 draws a frame between them. That is the trade to decide before any of it is
built, and it is not what either the tracked counts or the drawn counts say on their own.

## Decals: a second draw pass, and a single culling phase

The ranking put decals first at 181 drawn a frame in the Whiterun exterior, and the feasibility read said
they needed depth bias and blending in the pipeline key and an ordering guarantee against the geometry
underneath. Both turned out to be true and neither turned out to be large, because the engine's own
decal path answers the question that decides the architecture: **can a decal change the silhouette of
what it sits on?**

It cannot, and `docs/development/skyrim-engine-notes.md` ("Decals") has the decompile that says so. The
main pass draws its two decal groups after every opaque object, under a depth test against them, and
the opaque group's depth write is the host's depth pulled a bias toward the camera. A decal never
occludes anything its host does not. So decals are **occludees only**: they never enter the Z-prepass or
the two-phase replay, they are culled **once**, in the colour segment, against the HZB that the depth
segment rebuilt from this frame's depth, and they are drawn by a **second pass** in the same segment,
after the opaque colour pass, that tests LESS_EQUAL with the engine's bias and writes no depth at all.

### What the probe found before anything was built

`CS_DCLF_DECAL_PROBE=1` records, at every native decal draw, the accumulation hint, the alpha property,
the depth flags and the `RendererShadowState` indices the draw was issued with, and reads the D3D11
description of every distinct state object once. It corrected the decompile-derived plan in one place -
the group index is the hint plus one - and settled two things the decompile could not: which render flags
each group runs with (0x41 for hint 2, so the alpha property is not applied; 0x45 for hint 3, so it is),
and that both blend states the groups use fit BasicRHI's `BlendFactor` without an RHI change.

Whiterun exterior, per frame: 199 native decal draws, 140 in the opaque group and 58 in the blended one;
Dragonsreach 30 (17 / 13). The `RenderPassImmediately` thunks see every one of them (211 offered against
199 drawn), which is the hook-coverage question answered: withholding a decal's pass stops its native
draw.

### The pipeline key carries the engine's state indices

`PipelineKey::rasterFlags` was one bit (two-sided). It now packs the decal group and the engine's own
`rasterStateDepthBiasMode`, `alphaBlendMode`, `alphaBlendAlphaToCoverage`, `alphaBlendWriteMode` and
`alphaBlendModeExtra` (Records.h). Every opaque key keeps all of those at zero, so nothing about an
existing pipeline changed - the pipeline count did not move.

The indices are translated by reading the engine's state objects, not by re-deriving what each index
means: `DrawPipelines::CaptureEngineStates` takes `GetDesc` of the rasterizer and blend states behind
each key's bits (EngineStates.h: the tables at `RelocationID(524748, 411363)` and `(524749, 411364)`) and
keeps them in RHI terms for the asynchronous build. It runs from the first lighting draw of the deferred
pass, deliberately: Community Shaders swaps the blend table for its deferred variants between
`StartDeferred` and `ResetBlendStates`, and those - with RT1-2 forced to alpha blend - are what a native
decal in the G-buffer uses. A key whose state has not been captured is simply not ready.

Where the indices come from once DCLF owns the decal and there is no native draw to copy: the bias mode
from `DecalDepthBiasMode` (the `ToggleDepthBias` byte and `DrawWorld::disableSunShadows`, so interiors get
the no-bias modes 7 and 11), the blend mode from the alpha property's functions as `FUN_14150bc80`
chooses it, the write mode as the group function and SetupGeometry leave it (10; 1 with `kZBufferWrite`,
else 11). The probe checks the derivation against every native decal draw it still sees: **0 of 4,800
mismatched in Dragonsreach, 300 of 52,800 in the exterior**, every one of them write mode 11 derived
against 1 observed on a decal without `kZBufferWrite`. That is a leak from Community Shaders' Terrain
Blending, which sets write mode 1 for its own passes from the same hook that precedes the blended decals;
the only difference between the two modes is RT0's alpha mask, and the deferred composite never reads it.

### Ordering, by fixed slots rather than by an atomic append

Overlapping decals are drawn in the engine's order - the opaque group, then the blended one; within a
group the technique buckets ascending, each bucket's five lists, each list's chain - and RegisterPass
prepends, so a chain is drawn in reverse registration order. An atomic append in BuildDraws cannot promise
that order, and two overlapping decals landing in a different order each frame would flicker.

So a decal's sequence goes to a **fixed slot**: SceneStore sorts the frame's decals by that key
(`Tables::decalOrdinal`), the epoch hands each its ordinal in its `DrawInput`, and BuildDrawsCS writes
`sequences[kDecalSequenceBase + group * kMaxDecalDraws + ordinal]` - either the draw, or the same
sequence with an index count of zero when the culling rejected it or the epoch could not build its
record. Every decal input writes its slot, culled or not, so nothing a previous frame left there can be
executed; a guard in the epoch loop pushes a blank input on every path that gives up on a decal. Each
group's draw reads its slot count from its own count word, which the CPU uploads.

### The second pass

`MainOpaquePass::Record` begins a second pass on the same attachments, all loaded, after the opaque
`ExecuteIndirect`, and issues one indirect draw per group from that group's range. The depth segment
never sees a decal: its epoch skips them before the cull-only push, so they get no visibility verdict and
none is needed - the colour segment's BuildDraws tests them itself, frustum and HZB, and the HZB bound
there is the one rebuilt at the end of this frame's depth segment, so it is final. A decal with
`kZBufferWrite` keeps its native depth-pass draw (`SkipNativePass` exempts decals inside the depth pass):
DCLF writes no decal depth, and a depth-writing decal withheld from that pass would lose its depth
entirely.

Two instrument corrections came out of the parity runs. The per-geometry check compared TreeParams and
WindTimers for every object, and they compared clean by accident: SetupGeometry writes them for technique
12 only, the native buffer keeps whatever the last tree left, and no eligible object had been drawn after
a tree in the main range - until decals, which the engine draws after everything. The check now ignores
those two variables for non-trees. And the capped sample list is now two samples per variable, because
the standing PS PerMaterial 29 difference had filled it on its own for three stages running.

### Decals, landed (behind `CS_DCLF_DECALS`)

Whiterun exterior on the hybrid path (`CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=static`, `CS_DCLF_CULL=occlusion`,
`CS_DCLF_TABLES=tracked`), per frame: **176 decals submitted to the second pass** (136 in the opaque
group, 40 in the blended one), 28 of them culled; `decal ... 0 drawn` left native, down from 181. Claims
1465 -> 1641 with **0 claimed but not drawn**, decal build parity **176 slots, 0 differ**, opaque build
parity unchanged, 0 validation messages. Dragonsreach: 16 submitted, 3 culled, 0 differ.

Cost, profiled, against a control with the switch off at the same place: the table build 4.52 against
4.51 ms (noise), the colour epoch 2.06 against 1.90 ms - 0.16 ms for 176 more draws, most of it the graph
execution (+0.06-0.09) and the epoch prologue (+0.03). The native loop gives up the 176 draws.

**And the image got better, not merely equal.** The control frame is missing the cobblestone road to the
right of the player; the decal frame has it. The road is a blended decal (hint 3), which the engine draws
with depth test only, before `EndDeferred`; DCLF's opaque colour pass then ran at `BeforeDeferredComposite`,
after it, and painted the ground back over it - a standing defect of the hybrid path that nothing had
measured, because capture parity compares constants and the decal's constants were fine. Owning the decal
and drawing it after DCLF's own opaque pass is what restores the order the engine has. Opaque decals
(hint 2) survived before because their depth write wins the host's LESS_EQUAL test.

Left off by default, as trees are, until someone has watched decals in motion (blood, overlapping placed
decals, cell transitions). The switch set that validated it is the one above plus `CS_DCLF_DECALS=1`;
`CS_DCLF_DECAL_PROBE=1` reports the state parity and stays useful whenever ownership is off.

## Skinned objects: the engine's palette, DCLF's buffer

Skinned objects were the second-largest class by drawn count (150 a frame in the exterior, ~100 in
Dragonsreach) and the one the feasibility read called structural, because a bone palette is a
variable-length per-object array and nothing in the record was. The structural part turned out to be
small, because the engine already does the hard half: `docs/development/skyrim-engine-notes.md`
("Skinning") has the decompile. `NiSkinInstance::boneMatrices` holds the whole palette as three float4
rows a bone, in absolute world space, refreshed once a frame by `FUN_140e4ff90` under a frame stamp, with
the previous frame's palette kept beside it. The bone setter that runs from the native draw copies those
rows into b10 and b9 and nothing more. So DCLF has no skeleton, no bind pose and no palette builder. It
runs the same update from `BuildFrame` (the native draw it withholds would otherwise have been the only
caller), copies the rows into `Tables::bones` / `previousBones`, and gives each object an offset.

### What went where

-   **The buffers.** A skinned draw binds `partition->buffData`, the skin partition's own `TriShape`,
    not `geometry->rendererData` (measured: never the same object). The geometry entry for a skinned
    shape is built from the partition, with `partition->vertices` and `partition->triangles`, and it
    resolves through `GpuResources` like any other TriShape. Draw parity confirms the binding on every
    native draw.
-   **The palette buffer.** `DCLFBones`, a `StructuredBuffer<float4>` at VS t126 beside the object
    table, sized 65,536 rows; the pipeline layout's vertex-stage SRV range is now two registers. The
    epoch packs the frame's rows **eye-relative** the way it packs World - each row's translation loses
    the eye's component for that row - current rows first, then the previous frame's relative to the
    previous eye. The shader's pivot is therefore zero, and the depth epoch, which has its own eye, is
    right by construction; `BonesPivot` in the mirrored per-frame buffer (measured equal to `posAdjust`
    on all 62,000 draws checked) is not read at all.
-   **The record.** `BindlessObject` grew a row: `boneOffset`, `previousBoneOffset`, `boneRows`
    (176 -> 192 bytes). Under `DCLF_BINDLESS` the SKINNED vertex path calls
    `Skinned::GetBoneTransformMatrixBindless` / `GetBoneRSMatrixBindless` on `DCLFBones` at the object's
    offsets and declares no b9/b10 at all. The record deduplication is untouched: nothing per object
    entered the binding record.
-   **Eligibility** (`CS_DCLF_SKINNED=1`): a `BSTriShape` with an accumulated pass whose skin instance is
    exactly a `NiSkinInstance` with one partition and at most 80 bones (`skin-shape` counts the rest); the
    `kSkinned` property flag then selects the SKINNED permutation as before.

### Measured

Gate 1, ownership off, capture parity on. **Bone palette parity: 0 of 7,800 palettes differ in the
exterior, 0 of 42,000 in Dragonsreach** - the rows DCLF copies are byte-identical to the ones the native
draw bound at b9 and b10. Draw parity 0 differ, bindless record parity 0 differ over the new row, no new
material mismatches. The one new per-geometry class was World / PreviousWorld on skinned draws, which
SetupGeometry does not write for a skinned pass and the SKINNED vertex shader does not read; the parity
instrument now skips them for skinned objects, as it skips the wind variables for non-trees.

Gate 2, the hybrid path with static ownership and occlusion culling:

| | Dragonsreach | Whiterun exterior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| skinned candidates a frame | 250 | 33 |
| claims (control -> skinned) | 920 -> 990 | 1465 -> 1478 |
| claimed but not drawn | 0 | 0 |
| build parity | OK | OK |
| frustum false negatives | 0 | 0 |
| `skinning` build part | 0.071 ms | 0.009 ms |
| tables, profiled | 2.26 vs 1.83 ms | 4.83 ms |
| colour epoch | 1.36 vs 1.21 ms | 2.20 ms |

The A/B screenshots in Dragonsreach are the same frame; the banners are DCLF's in one and native in the
other. `CS_DCLF_SKINNED` stays off by default until someone has watched skinned objects in motion.

### What the probe put next

The exterior's single-partition class is small (33) because most of its skinned draws are elsewhere:
`skin-shape` leaves 94 a frame native there, 24 in Dragonsreach. The biggest piece is the
three-partition, tree-animated shape (29 a frame, hint 11, technique 12) whose partitions carry LOD bytes
1/2/0: the engine draws the partition the pass's LOD mode enables, through the table at `0x14202a030`,
so covering it means one DCLF object per enabled partition and reading that table. Then
`BSDismemberSkinInstance` (actor parts, one or two draws each, partitions toggled per frame). The
static-pose skip the plan reserved is not worth building: 191 of 201 palettes in the exterior change
every frame.

## ProjectedUV and terrain: the trees pattern, twice

Both classes were the "trees pattern": one per-object PerGeometry value the engine computes in
`SetupGeometry`, derived on the CPU and carried per object. They turned out to be that plus two things
the ranking could not see: ProjectedUV has three per-object *pixel* constants and four pipeline-level
textures as well as its matrix, and terrain is owned by Terrain Blending in this profile.

The per-object values live in the epoch's row buffer, after the bone palettes: `kExtraRows` (seven float4
rows) per object that needs them - LandBlendParams, the three rows of TextureProj, then ProjectedUVParams,
2 and 3 - with `BindlessObject::extraOffset` pointing at them and `DCLFObjects.hlsli`'s statics reading
them under `DCLF_BINDLESS`. The constant-buffer path patches the same variables through
`PatchObjectGeometry`, which is what capture parity compares. `SceneStore::RefreshObjectExtras` fills the
rows at Prepass, where the main camera's `posAdjust` is current, and it calls the engine's own
NiTransform-to-matrix and `D3DXMatrixMultiply` routines so that `TextureProj` is the native value to the
bit. The derivations themselves are in `docs/development/skyrim-engine-notes.md` ("ProjectedUV and
MTLand").

### What the gates found

`CS_DCLF_PROJECTED_UV=1 CS_DCLF_MTLAND=1`, ownership off, capture parity on, Whiterun exterior: 53
projected and 100 terrain candidates a frame; **no mismatches on LandBlendParams, TextureProj or the three
ProjectedUVParams** - the derivations are exact - and `projected-uv` and `technique` gone from the
left-native list. Two other things surfaced and were fixed:

-   **Terrain drew with the wrong vertex stride.** Draw parity reported every terrain draw with stride
    32 against the native 40. CommonLib's `VertexDesc::GetSize` sums the attribute sizes it knows and
    leaves the landscape data out; the engine binds the desc's stride nibble times four, which the engine
    notes had recorded all along. The geometry record now takes the nibble. It never showed before because
    no eligible object had landscape data.
-   **One tree a frame with amplitude 0 against 9.** Shrubs and ferns that are both tree-animated and
    projected became eligible, and one of them (`L2_SwordFern03`) holds an uninitialised negative squared
    distance on its node. The engine's fast square root shifts the bit pattern arithmetically and its
    result clamps to the maximum amplitude; DCLF's shifted logically and clamped to zero. A diagnostic
    that prints the derivation's inputs beside the live node's found it in one run; `FastSqrt` now
    matches the engine's shift.

### Terrain and Terrain Blending

Terrain Blending, on by default here, intercepts every `kMultiTextureLandscape` pass at
`RenderPassImmediately`, holds it, and redraws it after the opaque pass with alpha blending and its own
depth-stencil state (drawing below the surface, against a separate terrain depth). An opaque DCLF draw of
the same terrain would run under that, so `MtLandEnabled()` is false whenever Terrain Blending is loaded
and enabled *and* DCLF is drawing into the frame (the hybrid path). The tables and the parity still
exercise the derivation with the feature on, because its redraws happen inside the deferred pass where the
parity hook sees them; ownership of terrain needs either the feature off or a terrain sub-pass that does
what it does. The hybrid run with every class on reports 0 terrain candidates, as intended.

#### The terrain blended onto an empty G-buffer

With DCLF on, wherever a DCLF object met the terrain (rocks and dirt mounds half-buried in it), the blend
zone showed whitish blue instead of a blend into the object. The order in the main pass was:

1.  The engine's opaque batches, with DCLF's objects withheld.
2.  `Main_RenderWorld_BlendedDecals`: Terrain Blending's held terrain, then the engine's blended decals.
3.  `EndDeferred`: DCLF's colour epoch (`BeforeDeferredComposite`), then the composite.

The terrain is drawn with alpha blending onto the G-buffer, `LESS_EQUAL` and depth writes, and its alpha is
its distance to the depth beneath over 10 units (`Lighting.hlsl`, `blendFactorTerrain`). The depth already
held DCLF's objects from the Z-prepass, so the alpha was right, but the G-buffer did not hold them yet: the
terrain blended onto its clear values. Then the terrain's depth writes made DCLF's `EQUAL` test fail where it
covered the object, so the object never filled the zone in.

**The fix:** the colour epoch runs where the opaque batches end, at the start of the `BlendedDecals` hook
(`DrawcallLimitFix::AfterOpaquePass`), which is the native order. It unbinds the render targets before
the epoch and marks them dirty afterwards, as the Z-prepass does inside the depth pass.
`BeforeDeferredComposite` keeps the rest (the path off hybrid, the claims, the debug view).

Terrain Blending also holds the passes of meshes flagged `kNoTransparencyMultiSample` (a flag the engine does
not use, which marks a mesh the terrain should not blend over) and redraws them after the terrain with
`EQUAL`. DCLF now draws before the terrain, so those stay native while Terrain Blending is on
(`Ineligible::TerrainNoBlend`, "terrain-no-blend").

**Result**, the save by the tree roots: DCLF on and off match in screenshots; capture parity 0 mismatched,
0 untracked eligible; 0 claimed but not drawn. That save has no `kNoTransparencyMultiSample` meshes, so the
exclusion was not exercised.

### Everything on

Hybrid, `CS_DCLF_TREES CS_DCLF_DECALS CS_DCLF_SKINNED CS_DCLF_PROJECTED_UV CS_DCLF_MTLAND`, Whiterun
exterior: claims 1478 -> **1712**, 0 claimed but not drawn, build parity OK, 0 frustum false negatives,
one validation message (the semaphore one). Left native and drawn: skin-shape 89, unsupported-parent 51,
not-trishape 48, technique 35 (terrain, gated), actor 35, alpha-test-state 1.

## Persistent tables: the build that stops re-deriving the frame

`BuildFrame` used to rebuild every table from scratch each frame. In the Whiterun exterior that was 4.3 ms
for 10,000 tracked objects of which ~1,700 are drawn, and profiled by part it was almost all re-derivation
of things that do not change: the static classification (1.2 ms), the per-frame hidden/fade check for
every candidate (0.7), the record (0.95) and the pipeline/material dedup (0.5). Two steps, both behind
gates that read 0, took it to **2.1 ms**.

### A1: nothing for what cannot be drawn

With the draws gated on the engine's visibility (`CS_DCLF_CULL_INPUT=native`, the default) an object the
accumulator does not hold is a culling candidate and nothing more: it needs bounds, `kObjectNoBindings`
and a place in every parallel array. It now gets exactly that, and only that, and the depth segment still
submits it cull-only, so the culling's cross-tabulation is unchanged (5,577 tested before and after).
`=tracked` keeps the full path because it wants records for them.

Whether such an object is a candidate at all is the classification's answer, and that answer is kept on
the tracked entry (`Tracked::candidateReason`) and refreshed every 64 frames rather than recomputed per
frame: once the derived cache below had removed the classification itself, the loop head - the witness
loads and the negative-cache probe for ~8,300 objects - was most of what "classify-static" still measured.
A verdict a few frames old costs at most a diagnostic, because a candidate is tested by the culling and
drawn by nothing. The ineligibility histogram counts the kept verdicts, so it reads as before.

### A2: slot-stable tables and the derived cache

The three shared tables - geometries, pipelines, materials - keep their slots across frames. Each slot has
a `lastUsed` frame and its key; a sweep every 16 frames frees slots idle for 64 and erases their map
entries; the per-object arrays are still appended per frame (`Tables::ClearFrame`). Everything that reads
a pipeline by index (the epoch's blocks, EarlyPrepass's pipeline requests, `RefreshFrameConstants`) is
restricted to the slots used this frame.

Over that, `Tracked::Derived` caches the positive derivation for an accumulated object: the descriptors,
the static object flags, the pipeline key and the three slots. Its witnesses are the Stage 3 pointers
(TriShape, property, material) plus the fade state, the accumulated technique / sub-pass / hint, the
interior flag, whether the material alpha is below one, the frame's decal bias modes and the table
generation; and the slots are checked against their keys before they are served, so a swept and reused
slot cannot be handed back. A hit skips `ClassifyStatic` and the whole derived section; `ClassifyFrame`,
the alpha-test-state rule, the transforms, shading, palettes and the draw sequence still run.
`CS_DCLF_DERIVED_CACHE=off|on|probe` (`probe` serves the cache and recomputes, comparing slots, flags, key
and descriptors): **0 differ** over 1,712 objects a frame in the exterior, through Dragonsreach, back,
and a save/load, with the sweeps retiring 1,000-1,600 slots at each transition and 0 slot violations.

Three things the persistence surfaced, each of which was a one-frame artefact before and a standing one
after, which is the general lesson of this step - every value in a persistent slot has to be either
fixed or refreshed on purpose:

-   **The technique constants are the frame's** (fog, settings, and the shadow mask's view). They are now
    re-evaluated at Prepass for the used pipelines, with the geometry templates. Serving the slot's first
    evaluation was a parity regression and, at startup, a stale view pointer.
-   **The per-frame drift floats** (PS PerMaterial 29; superseded by "Material records from their
    sources") were learned by re-evaluating a cached material,
    which a persistent slot never does. The rolling validation slice (8 live materials a frame,
    re-evaluated and compared with what their slot serves) now learns them, seeds the patch source, and
    heals a stale record in place; at startup it reports a handful of stale slots as values settle, then
    0. Capture parity with every class on: PerMaterial 29 x91,200 and VS PerMaterial 11 x5,860 over
    523,000 checked draws, against x67,200 / x3,000 over 465,000 before - the same residue (standing debt),
    at a slightly higher rate that belongs with it.
-   **`GpuResources::Resolve` returned a pointer into a map whose storage moves.** Resolving the index
    buffer could reallocate the map and the vertex buffer's pointer then read garbage; rebuilt every frame
    the bad record lasted one frame, kept in a slot it lost the device on the first draw (3 of 14 startups,
    always at the first epoch). `CS_DCLF_SLOT_PROBE=1` - a fresh evaluation and a fresh resolve for every
    used slot, logged against what the slot serves - caught it in one failing run
    (`vb 0xb2104741d736cab1 -> 0x2562278000`, index address correct). `Resolve` returns by value now;
    0 of 6 startups after, 0 probe differences.

Also kept from this: a geometry slot found by address whose buffers no longer match (a TriShape
reallocated at the same address), or whose buffer references were evicted, or which was resolved while
the graph was off, is resolved again in place; the buffer references are touched on the slot's first use
of a frame; a pipeline's template is always a property of an object of the frame; `CheckObjectSlots`
neutralises any object naming a slot not of this frame and counts it (the gate: 0); the teardown paths
reset the maps and bump the generation.

### Measured, and the A3 decision

Whiterun exterior, hybrid, every class on, `CS_DCLF_PROFILE=1`, same place and hour:

| tables, ms      | control | A1   | A1+A2 |
|-----------------|---------|------|-------|
| total           | 4.8     | 4.3  | 2.12  |
| classify-static | 1.29    | 1.15 | 0.21  |
| classify-frame  | 0.68    | 0.69 | 0.19  |
| record          | 0.95    | 0.78 | 0.67  |
| dedup-hit       | 0.53    | 0.18 | 0.10  |
| loop-tail       | 0.38    | 0.36 | 0.36  |
| walk + lookup   | 0.47    | 0.48 | 0.46  |

Claims 1712 -> 1712, 0 claimed but not drawn, build parity OK, 5,578 tested / 0 frustum false negatives,
bone palette parity 0 of 7,800. What remains is per frame by nature: the walk and pass lookup (0.46), the
iteration over 10,000 tracked entries (0.36), and for the drawn objects their transforms, bounds, room
probe, shading and sequence (0.67 for 1,712 plus the 3,225 cull-only pushes). A3 - persistent object
slots - would save the pushes and the `objectIndex` insert, on the order of 0.2-0.3 ms of the 2.1, and is
not built; the next structural gain is Stage 6, where the engine's own per-object main-pass work is.

## Shadow views, step one: what the engine does, and a frame in two halves

### The probe (`CS_DCLF_SHADOW_PROBE=1`)

`DrawcallLimitFix/ShadowProbe.cpp` measures the shadow half of the frame before DCLF owns any of it: it
enumerates the views from the shadow scene node before the shadow maps are drawn, records the render
state at each shadow accumulator's `FinishAccumulatingPreResolveDepth`, samples the Utility draws'
constants, times each light, and cross-checks every Utility registration against the technique DCLF
would derive and the caster rule DCLF would apply. What it found is written up in
`skyrim-engine-notes.md` under "Shadow maps"; the four answers the design needed:

-   **The derivation is exact.** Over ~1M registrations in the exterior and the Bannered Mare, the
    technique derived from the property's flags and the view's render mode differed from the engine's
    `passEnum - 0x2B` **zero** times. For a Utility pass the `techniqueID` given to `RegisterPass` is the
    `passEnum` itself, not a descriptor as it is for Lighting.
-   **The caster rule is exact.** The rejection rule read off `GetRenderPasses_ShadowMapOrMask` rejected
    none of the casters the engine registered. Of the main pass's kept objects with no registration in a
    cascade, all but the alpha-blended ones are simply outside the cascade cull.
-   **Views need a viewport origin.** A paraboloid light's two hemispheres share one array slice as
    `(0,0) 4096x2048` and `(0,2048) 4096x2048`, and a focus shadow is `(0,3547) 549x549`. Half the drawn
    views are sub-rectangles, so `rhi::PassBeginInfo` cannot keep assuming the origin is (0,0).
-   **The eye is the shadow camera's.** Utility's `World` is eye-relative to the shadow camera's
    `posAdjust`, up to 15,000 units from the main camera's, and `VS_PerFrame` c8 holds the transpose of
    that camera's `viewProjMat`. A shadow epoch therefore adds an eye delta per view, as planned.

The cost it measured is the baseline S5 will be judged against: 2.3 ms of render-thread CPU per frame in
the exterior (2.2 of it in cascade 1's 2,569 draws), 0.5 ms for two point lights at night.

### The two-phase frame

Shadow views are drawn *inside* `Main_RenderShadowMaps`, and the main camera's passes are registered by
jobs that run concurrently with them - they are complete only when that call returns. So an object record
a shadow epoch can read has to exist before it, and the accumulator's half of the record cannot.
`SceneStore::BuildFrame` now takes a phase:

-   **`Phase::Scene`**, from `DrawcallLimitFix::BeforeShadowMaps`: the tracked walk, eligibility, the
    geometry slots and their buffer resolve, transforms, bounds, bone palettes, and one object record per
    eligible object - with no pipeline, no material, `kObjectNoBindings` and `kObjectNativeVisible` clear.
    Object indices are fixed for the frame from here.
-   **`Phase::Accumulate`**, at `EarlyPrepass` as before: the capture drain, the pipeline and material
    slots, the per-frame lighting template, shading, light lists, decal order and `kObjectNativeVisible`,
    patched into those records by object index.

Three things this split taught:

-   **The scene phase must not decide anything that needs the pass.** The decal rule is the one such
    rule - a decal's group comes from its accumulated pass's accumulation hint - and rejecting on it
    before the shadow maps left 452 accumulated objects without records and dropped claims from 1712 to
    1531. Decal verdicts are now deferred: the record is built, and the accumulate phase takes the verdict
    again with the pass in hand (`DeferredToAccumulate`).
-   **The per-frame classification still belongs to every frame.** The scene phase's verdict is cached
    for up to 64 frames, which is right for "is this object drawable at all" and wrong for hidden, actor
    and fading. The accumulate phase re-runs `ClassifyFrame` even when the derived cache hits, or an
    object that has just been hidden keeps its bindings.
-   **The second phase should iterate the passes, not the tracked set.** Walking all 10,053 tracked
    objects again to look up 1,700 accumulated ones cost 0.4 ms of pure loop; iterating
    `accumulatedPasses` and finding the tracked entry costs nothing measurable.

Measured against the A1/A2 build at the same place, every main-pass gate holds: claims 1719 (against
1712) with 0 claimed-but-not-drawn, capture parity clean in steady state, draw parity 0 of 13,843,
derived cache 1719 served / 0 differ, 0 slot violations.

| | A1/A2 (one phase) | two phases |
|---|---|---|
| tables CPU per frame | 2.12 ms | 2.77 ms (scene 1.60, accumulate 1.17) |
| object records | 4,937 | 5,358 |
| geometry slots | 645 | 953 |

The extra 0.65 ms is the scene phase giving records, geometry slots and transforms to every eligible
object rather than bounds alone to the ~3,200 the main camera's culling had rejected. That is the work
the shadow epochs exist to consume, and it is paid once for all views.

## Shadow views, step two: the views drawn, and the counters that say so

Step S2 of the shadow plan gives DCLF the sun's cascades - every view the engine draws with render mode
0xD-0xF that is not a focus shadow - behind `CS_DCLF_SHADOWS=1`, with static ownership of their casters
behind `CS_DCLF_SHADOW_OWNERSHIP=static`. Shadow correctness is judged by counters and readbacks alone
for now: Community Shaders' shadows are broken in general at the time of writing, so a screenshot says
nothing about DCLF's part in them.

### What was built

-   **`ShadowViews`** (`DrawcallLimitFix/ShadowViews.{h,cpp}`): the frame's views from the shadow scene
    node's caster array, in the engine's order, keyed by accumulator (what the 0x2A hook is called on)
    and by batch renderer (what the engine registers the view's Utility passes with). Each view also
    carries the accumulator's render mode from its last draw, which is what attributes a registration to
    a mode's claim set. The batch renderers of the non-focus views are published to `PassCapture` per
    frame, as the main camera's are.
-   **The shadow classification** in the scene phase: `ShadowCasterReject` (the engine's rule, 0 false
    rejections over ~1M registrations in step one) sets `kObjectNoShadow`; `ShadowUtilityTechnique`
    gives every object its Utility technique without the mode bits; two-sided and the alpha-test
    threshold are read from the property in the scene phase, because the shadow epoch needs them before
    the accumulate phase runs.
-   **Utility programs and the shadow pipeline set**: `ShaderPrograms::FindShadow` compiles
    `Utility.hlsl` with `DCLF_BINDLESS` per (technique | mode bits); the VS takes `World` from the
    object record plus a per-view eye delta (`DCLFEyeDelta`, b0 c2), bones from the bone rows with the
    same delta, `TreeParams` from the record, and `AlphaTestRefRS` from the record's threshold bits.
    `DrawPipelines::FindShadow` keeps a second pipeline set and indirect signature: depth only, LESS with
    writes, the engine's rasterizer bias for the key's bias mode, culling from the key, the shadow map's
    DSV format (`D16_UNORM`).
-   **Capture, then one epoch.** The 0x2A hook (`BSShaderAccumulator::FinishAccumulatingPreResolveDepth`)
    only *captures* a view after its native draws: target and slice from the renderer state, the
    viewport, `posAdjust`, the PerTechnique block (parabola parameters from the two globals, the eye
    delta) and a copy of `VS_PerFrame` as the engine wrote it for the view. `ExecuteShadowFrame`, at
    `AfterShadowMaps`, then runs *one* graph epoch for every captured view: the object records, bone rows,
    geometry table and binding records once; the draw inputs once per render mode present (a caster with a
    ready pipeline under that mode); per view a slot holding its two blocks at the head of the constant
    arena, its own copy of the binding records naming them, its sequence and count buffers, one
    `BuildDrawsCS` dispatch (frustum only, single phase, no engine-visibility gate) and one
    `ExecuteIndirect` into its slice through a per-slice DSV at the view's viewport origin
    (`rhi::PassBeginInfo::x,y`, added to BasicRHI for this).
-   **The volumetric copy.** The engine draws each cascade twice: into `kSHADOWMAPS_ESRAM` (4096², two
    slices) and again, through the same batch renderer, into `kVOLUMETRIC_LIGHTING_SHADOWMAPS_ESRAM`
    (512², two slices) for the volumetric lighting. A caster withheld from the renderer is missing from
    both draws, so under ownership DCLF must draw both: target 3 is the third imported shadow depth
    target. Before it was, exactly two views a frame reported "not ready (depth)".
-   **Static shadow ownership.** After a successful epoch the inputs of each mode become that mode's
    claim set (`PassCapture::PublishShadowClaims`); the registration hook withholds a Utility pass whose
    batch renderer belongs to a view of that mode and whose geometry is claimed. The exterior withholds
    ~2,150 of the cascades' registrations a frame with 5,176 claimed; the engine still draws the rest
    natively (actors, grass, LOD, terrain - nothing DCLF has a record for).
-   **Live toggles.** Every non-default feature - hybrid, ownership, the culling mode and input, the
    object classes, the shadow views and their ownership, and the diagnostic modes - is a `Toggles`
    entry seeded from its switch and edited in the DCLF menu. The render thread applies the requested
    set once per frame at `BeforeShadowMaps`; a change to a toggle that enters the classification drops
    every cached verdict and derivation (`SceneStore::InvalidateVerdicts`). The shadow system has its own
    switch there so it can be excluded while everything else is tested.

### The counters

Riverwood exterior, the standard switch set plus shadows and shadow ownership, 120 s:

| counter | value |
|---|---|
| views offered per frame | 5 (two cascades into target 2, the same two into target 3, one focus view) |
| views drawn / not ready / focus left native | 4 / 0 / 1 |
| inputs per mode (0xE) | 5,176 with 0 lacking a pipeline, 0 lacking a texture; 163 binding records |
| GPU culling, cascade 0 (sampled) | 5,176 tested, 111 drawn, 5,065 outside the frustum |
| GPU culling, cascade 1 (sampled) | 5,176 tested, 2,308 drawn, 2,868 outside |
| shadow ownership | 2,149 clamped passes withheld per frame, 5,176 claimed, 0 views not ready |
| main-pass gates | claims 1,712, 0 claimed-but-not-drawn in steady state (one transient of 2 during churn) |
| CPU per frame | 1.65 ms: capture 0.01, prepare 0.38, inputs 0.34, blocks 0.05, graph 0.87, claims 0.14 |

Two lessons the counters taught:

-   **The graph's execution is a per-epoch floor.** One epoch per view cost 4.4-6.0 ms a frame, of
    which 3.5-5.1 ms was the graph's own compile/prepare/record - the main epochs show the same ~0.9 ms
    "graph execute" part. One epoch for all views brought the shadow path to 1.65 ms with the same four
    views drawn. Anything that runs per view has to be a dispatch or a pass inside one epoch, never an
    epoch.
-   **A "not ready" count needs a reason.** The two unexplained not-ready views a frame were the
    volumetric copies; the per-reason counters (`setup`, `pipelines`, `tables`, `depth`, `epoch`,
    `capacity`) said `depth` and a once-per-target log line said target 3.

The engine's own shadow-map CPU with the probe on was 2.7 ms a frame before ownership; what the native
loop saves under ownership is not measured yet (step S5).

### Open, carried to S3-S5

Spot lights (mode 0xD, the clamped permutation) are built but untested for lack of a spot-lit cell in the
runs so far; parabolic lights (S3) and the focus views (S4) stay native; `HighDetailRange` is zero, the
depth bias uses mode 0 only, the samplers are the default wrap/anisotropic; the object records are rebuilt
per frame for the shadow epoch (0.38 ms) although the scene phase has them; the inputs cost two hash
lookups per caster per mode (0.34 ms); the claim set is rebuilt per frame (0.14 ms); the hole detector
counts not-ready views rather than withheld passes per view. The shadow image parity gate from the plan is
deferred until Community Shaders' shadows are themselves correct.

## Payloads built off the render thread

The GPU idle trace (`CS_GPU_IDLE_TRACE`) showed the GPU waiting 2-5 ms a ~24 ms frame for the render
thread, most of it DCLF's own CPU work at points where the GPU had already drained everything submitted:
0.8-1.5 ms before the main-opaque epoch, 0.8-1.4 ms before the Z-prepass, 0.2-0.5 ms before the shadow
epoch and 0.3-0.6 ms for the scene tables at the start of the frame. Reflex keeps the queue deliberately
shallow, so queue depth cannot hide those gaps. The work has to leave the render thread's path between
dependent GPU work. The work is split into phases, each gated on its own. All five have landed.

### The contract: prepare, build, commit

-   **Prepare** (render thread, at the kick): everything the build reads that is not fixed until the join
    is copied into an inputs struct: frame, eye pair, render flags, frame-slot masks, the resources'
    addresses, and the tables' and lookups' generations.
-   **Build** (`BuildMainPayload`, `BuildShadowPayload`): a pure function of the inputs, the tables and
    the lookups. It makes no engine, service or D3D11 call, and it writes only its payload. `probe` runs
    it twice for exactly this reason.
-   **Commit** (render thread, inside the epoch's `beforePrepare`): checks that the job's inputs equal the
    epoch's (`SameInputs`; a mismatch is *stale* and the epoch builds inline), then copies the frame
    blocks into their slots, patches the frame textures, uploads, and hands the frame to the graph.
    `BUFFER_UPLOAD`, the descriptor service and `ConstantEvaluator` stay on this thread.

**Lookups** (`DrawcallLimitFix/Lookups.h`, owned by `SceneStore`) replace what the build used to ask
services for. The render thread fills them where the service is legal: pipelines (set index, constant
tables, register usage per variant) at `EarlyPrepass`, material textures, samplers and projected
textures at the epoch's commit, and shadow pipelines and textures at the shadow commit. Frame constant
blocks moved into `frameConstants`, a buffer of fixed 64 KB slots (`FrameSlotOffset(stage, register)`),
so a record can name a block's address before the block exists.

**The worker** (`DrawcallLimitFix/AsyncWorker.{h,cpp}`) is one dedicated thread, `CS DCLF worker`, with
a small FIFO and a bounded join. A job that is late (`CS_DCLF_ASYNC_WAIT_MS`), fails or is stale falls
back to the inline build, and the worker's payload is dropped. `EndFrame` counts any job still
outstanding at the end of the frame as `leaked`. `SetActive(false)` drains the worker. ORG's task
service and the shader compilation pool were ruled out: the first is what `ExecuteFrame` fans onto while
the render thread waits on it, and the second is saturated exactly when a new cell loads.

### Phase 1 gate: the split, still inline

Every parity line matched the pre-split build: record dedup, bindless record, `BuildDraws` and decal
parity OK; capture parity at its standing material residue (the same windows as before, ±3%);
`0 claimed but not drawn`; shadow `0 views not ready`; `derived cache 0 differ, 0 slot violations`;
live toggle 900:960 clean. The idle trace did not change beyond noise. The shadow epoch's lookup
refresh first cost 0.8-1.0 ms because it walked the shadow textures per view. Collecting the alpha-tested
casters' diffuse textures once in the scene phase (`Tables::shadowTextureSet`) removed that cost.

### Phase 2: the colour job

The colour epoch replays the Z-prepass's eye and constants (the hybrid path), so its inputs are final at
`DrawcallLimitFix::Prepass`, right after `RefreshFrameConstants`, the frame's last writer of the tables.
The job is kicked there (`IndirectDraws::KickColourBuild`) and joined in `RunEpoch(MainOpaque)`. That
leaves 1.5-2 ms of native rendering between the kick and the join. The frame-slot masks the epoch will
supply are predicted from the previous colour epoch and checked like every other input. They change only
when the set of bound frame blocks changes, which happens on the first frame of a cell and on a load.

The join comes before the epoch refreshes the material lookups, and the order matters. The worker reads
the lookups until it finishes, so a refresh that grows them underneath the job is a data race. A refresh
that adds or changes an entry bumps the lookups' generation, which marks the job stale.

Gate (exterior → Dragonsreach → Riverwood, live toggle at 900:960, save and load, ~2,700 frames):

| check | `probe` | `on` |
|---|---|---|
| epochs using the worker's build | 295-300 of 300 per window | 295-300 of 300 per window |
| stale | 1-2 at `coc`/`load` (predicted masks), otherwise 0 | the same |
| late / failed / cancelled / leaked | 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 |
| payload comparison | 295-300 compared, **0 differ** | - |
| other parity lines and ownership | unchanged from Phase 1 | `0 claimed but not drawn` in every window |

GPU idle attributed to the main-opaque epoch (`main opaque inputs` + `main opaque` in the
`[GpuIdle] summary`, ms per frame, 300-frame windows): **0.42-1.55 before, 0.04-0.55 after**. The rest
is ORG's prepare/record/submit floor and the join's wait. The Z-prepass epoch is still built inline, and
its share swings by ±0.5 ms from run to run.

### Phase 3: the Z-prepass job, on a predicted eye

Between `EarlyPrepass` and the end of `Main_RenderDepth` nothing writes the tables: the accumulate phase
is their last writer, and `RefreshFrameConstants` runs later, at `Prepass`. The Z-prepass job is kicked
at the end of `EarlyPrepass` (`IndirectDraws::KickZPrepassBuild`) and joined by `RunEpoch(ZPrepass)`.
The only input not yet known at the kick is the eye, which the epoch captures from `posAdjust`. At
`EarlyPrepass`, `posAdjust` still holds the shadow cameras' eye, so the job uses a prediction:
`RE::Main::WorldRootCamera()->world.translate` for the eye, and last frame's captured eye for the
previous eye. The epoch compares both exactly with its capture, and a miss makes the job stale.
The miss count is reported on its own line (`[DCLF] async zprepass eye`). `drewLastFrame`, the gate the
Z-prepass uses without withholding, is snapshotted at the kick. The render thread's colour epoch is the
only writer of `drawnFrame`, and it runs after the join.

Two defects surfaced on the way, and both are fixed:

-   **One job could cancel another.** Dropping a job used `CancelPending()`, which empties the whole
    queue. With two jobs a frame, dropping the colour job could cancel a queued Z-prepass job.
    `AsyncWorker::Cancel(handle)` ends one job: it is dequeued, or waited for if it is already running.
-   **A newly resolved lookup did not make a job stale.** The lookups' generation was bumped only when an
    already-resolved entry changed. A material resolved for the first time in the epoch's refresh left
    the job looking current, yet the job had deferred those draws. The probe caught it right after a
    `coc` (`constants: 4912 vs 82720 bytes`). Under ownership that would be one frame of missing depth
    for the claimed objects. Any change a build can observe now bumps the generation, including an
    entry resolved for the first time. As a result, the Z job goes stale for 2-3 frames after a cell
    change and while textures stream in at startup.

`CS_DCLF_ASYNC_EYE` was dropped: the prediction has not missed once, and `CS_DCLF_ASYNC_JOBS` without
`zprepass` already keeps the Z-prepass inline.

Gate (the same route and switches as Phase 2):

| check | `probe` | `on` |
|---|---|---|
| Z-prepass epochs using the worker's build | 296-300 of 300 per window | 285-300 of 300 per window |
| stale | 3 at each `coc` | 2-11 (startup streaming, `coc`, `load`), 0 in steady state |
| predicted eye missed | 0 | 0 |
| late / failed / cancelled / leaked | 0 | 0 |
| payload comparison | 296-300 compared, **0 differ** (colour and Z-prepass) | - |
| other parity lines | record dedup, bindless record, `BuildDraws` OK; derived cache 0 differ, 0 slot violations | - |
| ownership | 0 claimed but not drawn | 3 in the startup window only (the standing transient: every run since the Phase 0 baseline has 1-3) |

GPU idle attributed to the Z-prepass epoch (`Z-prepass inputs` + `Z-prepass`, ms per frame, 300-frame
windows): **0.61-1.40 before, 0.06-0.40 after**. The main-opaque share stays at 0.01-0.43.

### Phase 4: the shadow inputs job

The shadow epoch's inputs are final at `BeforeShadowMaps`, right after the scene phase and
`BeginShadowFrame` (the reference eye). Between there and `AfterShadowMaps` nothing writes the tables:
every writer is in the scene phase (before) or the accumulate phase (after), and `ExecuteShadowView`
and the shadow probe only read. The job is kicked there (`IndirectDraws::KickShadowBuild`) and joined by
`ExecuteShadowFrame`. Its window is the engine's entire shadow-map pass. Two inputs are unknown until
the views are captured: the render modes, and the DSV format the shadow pipelines are looked up for.
The job builds for last frame's modes. The epoch compares the modes with its own set, and a DSV format
change shows up as a changed shadow pipeline lookup, which bumps the generation. Either makes the job
stale. `SharedData` and `FeatureData` are copied at the kick and compared as well.

Gate (same route and switches):

| check | `probe` | `on` |
|---|---|---|
| shadow epochs using the worker's build | 290-300 of 300 per window | 290-300 of 300 per window |
| stale | 6 at startup (lookups resolving), 1-3 at a mode change (`coc` into Dragonsreach's paraboloid views and back) | the same |
| late / failed / cancelled / leaked | 0 | 0 |
| payload comparison | 290-300 compared, **0 differ**, in both the cascades (0xE) and the paraboloid views (0xF) | - |
| shadow ownership | 0 views not ready outside the startup window (the standing 12) | the same |
| join wait | ≤0.001 ms average | ≤0.001 ms average |

Shadow epoch CPU per frame on the render thread: **1.93 ms before, 1.14 ms after** (preparing 0.79 →
0.04 ms). What is left is the graph's own compile/prepare/record (0.95 ms) and publishing the claims
(0.15 ms). GPU idle attributed to the shadow epoch is 0.22-0.34 ms/frame, against 0.16-0.54 before:
the ORG floor.

### Phase 5: the scene walk

The scene phase cost the render thread 1.8-2.3 ms a frame in the exterior (26 ms on the frame after a
load), more than any epoch. `BuildScenePhase` is now split into three parts:

-   **Prologue** (render thread, `BeforeShadowMaps`): the load-screen branch, the frame globals,
    `SweepSlots`, the lighting shader, and the iteration order over `tracked`. When the walk is going to
    the worker, `PrepareSceneJob` also makes the two calls the walk would otherwise make that only the
    render thread may: `GpuResources::Touch` for every geometry slot used last frame, and the engine's
    palette update (`UpdateSkin`, AE `0xe4ff90`) for last frame's skinned objects.
-   **Walk** (`SceneWalk`, on the worker or inline): today's loop, unchanged except for what it may not do
    off the render thread. A geometry slot that is new, changed, or not touched ahead, and a skin the
    prologue did not update, count as *misses* instead. That happens on the frame after a cell change
    (thousands of misses) and when a new skinned object becomes eligible.
-   **Join** (`JoinScenePhase`, render thread): at `AfterShadowMaps`, so the window is the engine's whole
    shadow-map pass. `EarlyPrepass` and Present also call it, in case the frame drew no shadow maps. A
    walk with misses is replaced by an inline walk, which resolves them. The shadow build queued behind the
    walk is first allowed to finish (`AsyncWorker::WaitIdle`), then made stale by `GetSceneRebuilds`.

The window was audited rather than assumed:

-   `tracked` changes only in `ProcessEvents`, at Present.
-   The skip hook returns before `FindObject` for every pass outside the depth and deferred passes, so
    the native shadow draws never read `objectIndex`.
-   `ExecuteShadowView` no longer reads the tables. It only checks whether they are ready, and
    `ExecuteShadowFrame` makes the same check after the join.
-   The shadow probe reads the tables in the window, so the walk stays inline while
    `CS_DCLF_SHADOW_PROBE=1`.
-   The engine data the walk reads (world and previous-world transforms, bounds, runtime data, properties,
    materials, fade nodes, the parent chain, palettes) is the data the render thread read at this same
    point before. Its only calls are side-effect-free virtuals (`GetRTTI`, `GetType`, `GetUserData`,
    `GetFeature`).

`probe` re-walks on the render thread at the join and compares the per-object arrays byte for byte,
including the slots-used vector. A difference would mean either a walk that is not a function of its
inputs, or engine data that changed during the shadow maps.

Gate (same route and switches):

| check | `probe` | `on` |
|---|---|---|
| walks used | 299-300 of 300 per window | 299-300 of 300 per window |
| rebuilt inline | 1 per cell change (2,266-5,349 geometry misses, 0-12 skin misses) | the same |
| slot touches failed ahead | 0 | 0 |
| comparison | 299-300 compared, **0 differ** | - |
| every other job | 0 differ, 0 late, 0 leaked | 0 late, 0 leaked |
| parity and ownership | slot probe 0 differ; bone palettes 0 differ; derived cache 0 differ, 0 slot violations; capture parity at its standing residue; 0 claimed but not drawn | 0 claimed but not drawn except 4 in the startup window (the standing transient) |

Render-thread CPU of the scene phase: **1.8-2.3 ms before, 0.14-0.18 ms after** (the prologue).
Scene-phase GPU idle: 0.06-0.64 ms/frame before, ≤0.04 after.

What moved rather than disappeared: the walk (1.1-1.5 ms on the worker) and the shadow build chained
behind it (0.5-0.7 ms) take longer than the engine's shadow-map pass. The render thread therefore waits
0.6-0.9 ms on average at `AfterShadowMaps` (0.3-0.6 of it for the shadow build). The GPU has the shadow
maps to draw during that wait, so little of it shows as idle.

### All five jobs, `on`

GPU idle per frame, 300-frame windows, the same route (exterior → Dragonsreach → Riverwood, save, load):

| window | idle before (Phase 0) | idle after | `CS DCLF` share before | after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| exterior, startup | 0.81 | 0.37 | 0.71 | 0.32 |
| Dragonsreach | 2.34-2.98 | 1.48-3.77 | 1.32-2.47 | 0.47-0.83 |
| Riverwood and after save/load | 2.02-4.96 | 0.27-2.04 | 1.66-4.03 | 0.22-1.33 |

The `CS DCLF` share that remains is ORG's own prepare/record/submit per epoch, plus the joins' waits.
In Dragonsreach the total idle did not fall with the DCLF share: what remains there is not DCLF's.
Frame rate is not a usable signal on this route: medians ranged from 36.5 to 46.1 fps across runs with
no trend by phase.

Open:

-   The worker's builds take 0.8-2.0 ms, against ~1.0 ms for the same build inline. The 9800X3D has no
    hybrid cores, so the likely cause is contention with the render thread's native rendering. The colour
    join therefore still waits 0.1-0.5 ms on average. The Z-prepass join barely waits (≤0.02 ms average)
    because its window is longer. Next is a cheaper build: the two main epochs still build their object
    records, bone rows and geometry table separately.
-   The join at `AfterShadowMaps` waits 0.6-0.9 ms. The scene walk and the shadow build need a longer
    window than the shadow-map pass, or a cheaper walk.
-   The standing startup transient of 1-4 claimed-but-not-drawn objects in the first 300 frames: present
    since the Phase 0 baseline, and not yet traced.

## Epoch costs: measured, and the first two cuts

`CS_ORG_EPOCH_STATS=1` now splits each epoch's render-thread time by segment and by phase of ORG's host frame
(`PersistentGraphHost::LastFrameTimings`, `RenderGraph::LastPersistentExecuteTimings`), and counts the queue
submissions the graph hands to DXVK. Baseline after the async work (µs per epoch, exterior):

| epoch | total | inputs (commit + join) | prepare | admission | record | other ORG | submissions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LLF light culling | 579 | 6 | 245 | 84 | 110 | 134 | 5 |
| Z-prepass | 822 | 159 | 216 | 86 | 221 | 140 | 5 |
| main opaque | 1,296 | 634 | 175 | 89 | 237 | 161 | 5 |
| shadow views | 1,354 | 677 | 219 | 95 | 213 | 150 | 5 |
| debug view | 300 | 0 | 59 | 63 | 64 | 114 | 3 |

What that showed:

-   **The inputs phase is mostly the join wait.** The colour join waits 0.52 ms and the shadow join 0.57 ms,
    because the worker's builds are slower than their windows. The table work (the next steps) removes this.
-   **ORG costs 0.55-0.65 ms per epoch** whatever the epoch does: prepare, admission and record dominate,
    because every epoch prepares and records every pass of every feature.
-   **`HostWait` is cheap** (25-50 µs). The GPU is not what holds the render thread at an epoch's start.
-   **The debug-view epoch ran every frame** on the hybrid path: its targets are imported there anyway, and their
    presence was the only gate. It is now gated on the debug-view toggle, which removes 0.3 ms of render thread and
    three submissions a frame.
-   **DXVK held the pre-epoch D3D11 work back.** It closes its command list only when the epoch's first
    submission is enqueued, after ORG has prepared and recorded. So the D3D11 commands issued just before an epoch
    sat on the CPU for 0.5-1 ms while the GPU ran dry. `ExecuteEpoch` now flushes the immediate context first
    (`CS_ORG_EARLY_FLUSH=0` restores the old behaviour); the enqueue then finds nothing pending, so the
    submission count is unchanged.

A/B with the same build (Riverwood windows, GPU idle attributed to `CS DCLF`, ms per frame): early flush off
1.23-2.17, on **0.56-1.08**; total idle 2.28-4.70 against 0.97-2.24. What remains is the main-opaque epoch
(ORG 0.26-0.35, the colour join 0.19-0.32); shadow and Z-prepass are down to 0.05-0.23.

## Less work per build: the eye on the GPU, a build cache, no per-frame object map

### The eye moved to the GPU

The object records and bone rows were made eye-relative on the CPU (`StoreRelative`, `PackBoneRows`). That is
why the shadow, Z-prepass and colour builds could not share them, and why the Z-prepass job needed a predicted
eye. Every DCLF draw already receives its epoch's `VS_PerFrame` (b12). A check on every epoch and every shadow view
confirmed, bit for bit, that its `CameraPosAdjust` (c40) is the eye the records were made relative to, and its
`CameraPreviousPosAdjust` (c41) the previous eye: 6,000 main epochs and 13,200 shadow views, 0 different.

-   Records and bone rows are absolute now. `Lighting.hlsl` subtracts `BonesPivot`/`PreviousBonesPivot`
    (c40/c41 of its own `VS_PerFrame`, now declared under `DCLF_BINDLESS` as well as `SKINNED`) with `precise`.
    That is the same single float subtraction the CPU did, so the depth and colour epochs agree to the bit.
-   `Skinned::GetBoneTransformMatrixBindless` takes the pivot and subtracts it per bone before the blend, as the
    engine's own `GetBoneTransformMatrix` does.
-   `Utility.hlsl` subtracts the drawing view's own `CameraPosAdjust`, so `DCLFEyeDelta` is no longer read (left
    zero). The shadow result is now closer to the engine's own, which subtracts the view's eye from the absolute
    matrix, than the old two-step delta was.
-   The bindless parity check makes the absolute record relative with the same subtraction before comparing:
    `bindless record parity OK` over 245M components.
-   A bindless build no longer reads the eye unless the parity checks are on (`BuildReadsEye`), so the eye is
    not an input of the Z-prepass job and cannot make it stale.

Gate: capture parity at its standing residue, `BuildDraws parity OK`, `0 claimed but not drawn` (the Z/colour
EQUAL test holds), every job `probe 0 differ`.

### A build cache for the (material, pipeline) pairs

`BuildCache` (`CS_DCLF_BUILD_CACHE`, default on, `=0` off), one per main epoch kind, keeps each pair's resolved
texture and sampler indices and packed PerMaterial groups across frames, and each pipeline's packed PerTechnique
groups and PerGeometry template. An entry keeps a copy of every input it was derived from and is reused only when
this build's inputs are byte-identical, so it cannot serve a stale value. `CS_DCLF_ASYNC=probe` checks that every
epoch: the worker's build uses the cache and the inline build does not, and their bytes are compared.

Three things the numbers corrected:

-   **The drifting IBL floats.** `RefreshMaterialPatch` writes them into every material each frame, which
    rebuilt every pair every frame (hit rate ~0%). The signature now leaves out the patched positions
    (`MainInputs::materialPatchedFloats`), and a reused PS group gets this frame's values written at their packed
    offsets (`PackedPositionOf`), exactly as `PackConstantGroup` would.
-   **The signature must be cheaper than what it saves.** Copying the 2.3 KB material record into each pair's
    signature cost more than the texture loops it replaced. `Tables::materialVersion`, a session-unique number
    set whenever a slot's record is written, apart from the patch, now stands in for it.
-   **Pipelines still rebuild in the exterior.** Their evaluated PerTechnique and PerGeometry constants change
    every frame (EyePosition, fog). There are only 48 of them, so they are left alone.

Result: 99.5-100% of pairs reused. The colour build takes 1.22 ms instead of 1.50, its join waits 0.21 ms instead
of 0.53, and the GPU idle during `main opaque inputs` fell from 0.19-0.32 to 0.04-0.09 ms per frame.

### No per-frame object map

The scene walk rebuilt a geometry-to-index hash map every frame for about 5,300 objects. The index now lives in
the object's `Tracked` entry (`objectStamp`, `objectId`), valid while it matches the walk's stamp. The accumulate
phase already holds the entry, and `FindObject` looks it up in the persistent tracked map. The accumulate phase got
0.1 ms faster; the walk did not. Its cost is reading scattered engine memory for every object (world and previous
world, bounds, properties, the parent chain), not the tables it writes: the same conclusion as "the transform
witness cannot pay for itself" above. Skipping unchanged objects would still have to read them to know.

### Where the frame's DCLF bubbles stand

After early flush, the debug-view fix, the GPU eye and the build cache, DCLF-attributed GPU idle is about 1 ms per
frame in the exterior, split roughly as follows:

-   the shadow epoch, 0.5-0.7 ms: ORG, plus the wait at `AfterShadowMaps` for the scene walk (1.1-1.6 ms on the
    worker) and the shadow build chained behind it;
-   ORG in the main-opaque epoch, 0.3-0.45 ms;
-   the Z-prepass, 0.1-0.2 ms.

ORG costs 0.55-0.65 ms of render thread per epoch whatever the epoch does, because every epoch prepares, admits
and records every pass of every feature. That is the next lever: epoch variants (plan step O2), and after them
worker-side recording.

## Epochs: each submission point runs only its own passes

Every ORG epoch used to prepare, admit, record and submit every pass of every feature. The shadow epoch prepared
LLF's culling passes and DCLF's colour passes, which then returned empty work. ORG now has host epochs
(`extern/OpenRenderGraph/docs/persistent-epochs.md`).

-   **One epoch-aware compile.** The persistent program compiles once over the whole frame, epochs in frame
    order, so scheduling and transient aliasing see every segment's lifetimes. Transients in different epochs
    can share memory.
-   **Per-epoch executables.** Each epoch also gets an executable compiled from its own passes over the same
    bindings and placements. It is what runs at that epoch, and its entry states come from the admission
    ledger, so an epoch that did not run is harmless.

This was chosen over one compile per epoch because that would have given each epoch its own alias plan (no
memory shared across epochs) and turned every resource crossing epochs into an external one.

CS's side (`CS_ORG_EPOCHS`, default on, `=0` for the old behaviour):

-   Each segment is an epoch, in frame order: shadow views, Z-prepass, light culling, main opaque, debug view.
-   Every pass declares its segment.
-   The Z-prepass has its own `cs.dclf.z.build-draws` and `cs.dclf.z.depth` instances, where before one
    `build-draws`/`main-opaque` pair served both the depth and colour segments.

One thing the first run found: ORG derives hazards in authored (registration) order. Across epochs that order
meant nothing, and the epoch edges then closed a cycle ("Captured dependency graph contains a cycle"). The
program now reassigns authored order by epoch rank, then registration order.

Measured, same build, `CS_ORG_EPOCHS=0` against on. ORG's render-thread µs per epoch, everything but the feature
inputs:

| epoch | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| LLF light culling | 638 | 491 |
| Z-prepass | 712 | 598 |
| main opaque | 675 | 564 |
| shadow views | 689 | 591 |

That is about 0.5 ms of render thread per frame. Admission, recording and commit fell with the pass count. The
rest of each epoch is fixed cost, which the split does not touch:

-   ORG's per-frame polls and statistics setup, about 100 µs;
-   the host upload pass, 44 µs every epoch;
-   retirement and command-list acquisition;
-   five queue submissions per epoch.

ORG's per-pass preparation is only 3-19 µs a pass. The idle trace does not separate the two runs beyond noise.

Gate: probe 0 differ for every job, `BuildDraws parity OK`, capture parity at its residue, `0 claimed but not
drawn`, and save/load and the live toggle clean. ORG's test suite passes in the CS embedding configuration,
including a new epoch test in `PersistentGraphTests`.

What remains per epoch is fixed ORG cost, which the next section addresses.

## Epochs that only submit

The goal: at each epoch point, the render thread takes a ready ticket, writes the epoch's late values, and hands
one submission to DXVK. Everything else runs earlier, on other threads. ORG's side of the contract is in
`extern/OpenRenderGraph/docs/persistent-epochs.md` (closed executions, tickets, latches, staged uploads).
It is on by default since 2026-09-24 (`CS_ORG_ASYNC_EPOCHS=0` returns to the synchronous path, which stays).

Render-thread µs per epoch, feature body included (`CS_ORG_EPOCH_STATS=1`, the "Epoch body" lines). Later
rows are the async path. Steady exterior; later runs vary by about ±20 µs.

| stage | LLF | Z-prepass | main opaque | shadow views |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| before (synchronous) | 197 | 428 | 689 | 1343 |
| one submission per epoch | 163 | 366 | 343 | 1083 |
| latched values (LLF) | 100 | | | |
| tickets | 20 | 163 | 204 | 1044 |
| payloads staged on the workers | 24 | 71 | 135 | 939 |
| scene walk from `Main::Draw` | 26 | 74 | 125 | 158 |
| lookups reused, claims on the worker | 20-22 | 53-64 | 100-126 | 82-120 |

In total, about 2.65 ms of render thread per frame fell to about 0.3 ms. GPU pass times did not change.

### The stages

-   **One submission per epoch.** `PreparedRhiExecutionBatch::Submit` folds its waits and signals into one
    queue submission. A new DXVK export, `dxvkEnqueueInteropSubmissions`, takes several submit infos into one
    `vkQueueSubmit2`. CS batches the hook's submissions inside an epoch (`CS_ORG_BATCH_SUBMIT=0` turns that off).
-   **Latched values.** BuildDraws and LLF read their per-epoch values from an `org::LatchBlock` region:
    counts, cull flags, the view-projection matrix, the dispatch size, and LLF's lights and matrices. A reused
    recording is correct without re-recording. Pass shapes (capacities, which grow to powers of two, and
    generations) replace the per-frame values in the passes' revisions. Invocation reuse went to about 99.9%.
-   **Closed executions.** Each epoch returns everything it touches to its home state, and admission is cached
    per epoch (`CS_ORG_CLOSED`, on with epochs). Vulkan synchronization validation was clean for 60 s.
-   **Tickets.** ORG's host thread prepares each epoch's ticket a frame ahead. The epoch's own cost on the render
    thread is the feature's commit, a revision check, the upload recording and the submit. The feature's
    completed-epoch timings reach the render thread through an atomic inbox.
-   **Staged payloads.** Each DCLF job stages its payload's uploads on the worker, straight into mapped upload
    pages (`StageMainPayload`, `StageShadowPayload`). The shadow job stages the record copies for the number
    of views it expects (last frame's count), and the commit uploads only what depends on the captured views.
    The commits' own small uploads go through one staged batch per commit (`CommitUploads`). The upload pass
    now records nothing in steady state.

A bug the staging found: ORG's `UploadManager` created its upload instance only on the first `UploadData`. Once
every DCLF upload was staged, none came, and the staged calls were silently dropped. DCLF's static objects
disappeared (trees, actors and terrain are native, so they stayed). The manager now creates the instance on the
first staged call too, and keeps the direct-recording setting for instances created later.

A second one, from synchronization validation with async epochs: when a commit staged its batch but its epoch
was never submitted, the next epoch's list carried both batches, and their copies into `cs.dclf.constants`
overlapped with no barrier between them. ORG now orders overlapping copies within a list with a barrier.
Validation is clean for 120 s, cell changes and the live toggle included.

A third one, found by the shadow-map readbacks (2026-09-24): with async epochs, **every shadow draw used pipeline 0**.
The far cascade read a mean depth of 0.02 with nothing clear (native: 0.60, 31% clear), and alpha-tested casters
lost their alpha test.
-   **Why:** a shadow view's inputs name a key slot, and BuildDraws resolves it through the view's row of the
    pipeline map in the latch. The shader reads that row at an offset into the whole latch block, but the commit
    wrote it relative to the slot's region. So every view read slot 0's rows.
-   **Why it only showed with async epochs:** synchronous epochs write slot 0 every few frames, and the map is
    stable, so the stale rows matched. Async epochs hand the ring's slots to epochs in turn, and the shadow epoch
    never took slot 0: its rows stayed zero. Every draw, faces included, got pipeline 0. Faces drawn with a
    one-stream pipeline read their other attributes as positions and covered the cascade.
-   **The fix:** `pipelineMapOffset` carries the slot's base, `LatchBlock::Offset(slot)`, as the dispatch's own
    `LatchOffset` does.
-   **Verification:** a readback of the far cascade's generated sequences, a temporary probe since removed, showed
    24 pipelines in the same draw distribution as synchronous epochs (face draws only on face pipelines).
    With both async switches on, the shadow maps read 0.603 / 0.605 with DCLF on against 0.602 / 0.604 off. The
    face-positions buffer was byte-identical to the snapshots in both modes, so the data was never at fault.

### The scene walk starts at `Main::Draw` (AE)

After the stages above, the largest render-thread cost was the join on the scene walk at `AfterShadowMaps`,
about 0.6 ms. The walk (about 1 ms) was kicked at `BeforeShadowMaps`, and only the shadow-map pass (about 0.4
ms) covered it.

`Main::Draw` (AE 36559, from the Ghidra database) runs, in order:

1.  an `NiUpdateData` update, `FUN_1406452c0`, its first call (`+0xD3`);
2.  the main camera's cull jobs (`DrawWorld_BuildSceneLists`);
3.  `CalculateAndDrawShadowCasterLights` and the first-person cull;
4.  `RenderShadowMaps` (`+0x2EC`, Deferred's hook).

From steps 1 to 4 is about 1.2 ms in the exterior. `DrawcallLimitFix::BeginSceneFrame` now runs from a hook on
the `+0xD3` call, after it returns. There the toggles begin the frame, and SceneStore's scene phase kicks the
walk. `CS_DCLF_EARLY_SCENE=0` restores the old kick point. The walk now overlaps the engine's cull jobs, which
slows it to about 1.2 ms. The join wait fell from 0.57 ms to about 0.02 ms, and whole-frame time did not change.

What the walk reads that changes between the hook and `BeforeShadowMaps`, each found by decompiling:

-   **`BSFadeNode::currentFade`.** Written by `BSFadeNode::OnVisible` in the cull. The walk's eligibility
    verdicts are cached for `kCandidateRefreshFrames` anyway, and the accumulate phase catches a stale one, so a
    frame of lag changes nothing.
-   **A billboard's world rotation.** `NiBillboardNode::OnVisible` turns it to the camera in the cull.
    Geometry under an `NiBillboardNode` now has its own ineligibility reason, `billboard`, and stays native.
    A census through the exterior, Dragonsreach and Riverwood found only effect-shader geometry under
    billboards (flares, fire jets, glow planes), which DCLF does not draw anyway: `billboard` never appears in
    the histogram. Tree LOD is not billboard geometry. It is `BSDistantTreeShader`, which faces its quads to
    the camera in its own vertex shader, and like all LOD it lives outside the loaded cells DCLF tracks.
-   **Animated texture transforms.** `BSLightingShaderPropertyFloatController::Update` moves a material's UV
    offset in that window. The async scene probe found it, one frame behind on `antsMiddle01`. The walk no
    longer stores the texture transform: the shadow build, kicked at `BeforeShadowMaps`, reads it off the
    material.
-   **Hidden bits (found 2026-09-24).** Three engine paths set `kHidden` on nodes the walk classifies, for part
    of this window, and then restore it:
    -   `ShadowSceneNode::OnVisible` hides a portal graph's always-render children and its shared node during
        the room traversal (in the cull jobs);
    -   `TESWaterReflections::Update` (`0x140520570`) hides the player's 3D while a cube-map reflection updates.
        `Main::Draw` calls it on the render thread between the cull jobs' `Begin` and `Finish`;
    -   `Main::Draw` hides the player's first-person skeleton right after the walk's hook, and keeps it hidden
        for every world view.

    The worker read the transient bit on the frames a reflection updated. The player's face shapes, which are
    classified every frame, left the tables for that frame (the "'MaleHeadNord' was drawn last frame but is not
    in this frame's tables" warnings, about 250 a run at Riverwood). `SceneStore::CaptureCullHiddenBits` now
    records those nodes' bits on the render thread before the kick, with the first-person skeleton as hidden,
    and `ClassifyFrame` reads a listed node's bit from there. After the fix: 0 head drops and 0 withheld passes
    handed back. Two `Salmon:0` drops a run remain, also only with the asynchronous walk and not yet traced.
    That is the class of problem "event-driven tables" ([dclf-event-driven-tables.md](./dclf-event-driven-tables.md))
    removes: a worker reading a scene the engine is modifying.

Only plain `BSTriShape` geometry is eligible, so the cull-time LOD selection of `BSLODMultiIndexTriShape` and its
relatives does not matter. The skin palette update keys on `gFrameCounter`, which only `Renderer::End` advances,
so updating from the earlier point stays idempotent within the frame. Every DCLF hook that could fire in the new
window (water reflections are drawn in it) is gated on the main camera's depth or deferred pass, so nothing on
the render thread reads the tables while the worker writes them.

**Since Phase 2 of [dclf-event-driven-tables.md](./dclf-event-driven-tables.md) (2026-09-24) the walk no longer runs
on the worker.** The delta walk evaluates, on the render thread at this hook, only what can have changed, so nothing
reads the scene while the cull modifies it. The fade is taken from events on its writers instead of from the node
in the middle of the cull. `CS_DCLF_SCENE_DELTA=0` restores the worker's walk this section describes.

The shadow-build probe still differs in about 1-6 of 300 frames, always at the alpha-tested texture-transform
block. The scroll also moves during the shadow pass itself, so builds made at different moments read different
offsets. The scene probe used to show the same thing at about 1 in 300 frames.

### Smaller cuts

-   **The ticket's upload list.** Resetting and beginning it (about 6 µs of driver work) moved to the host
    thread, which already waits for the slot. What remains on the render thread is the copies themselves:
    `vkCmdCopyBuffer` measured 0.47 µs each, about 15 per epoch, plus a 2.4 µs barrier.
-   **Material lookups.** `RefreshMaterialLookups` runs in the shadow, Z and colour commits. An unchanged
    material (same views, same written mask, no GpuTextures eviction since) now keeps its indices. It is
    resolved again every `GpuTextures::kRestampFrames` (32) frames, because resolving is what keeps an entry
    from eviction (`kEvictFrames` 600). The cost went from 18 to 5 µs.
-   **Shadow claims.** The shadow job builds each mode's claim set. The epoch publishes it when it drew the
    job's build, and otherwise builds it as before. This took 48 µs per frame off the render thread.

### Not yet at the gate

The target was under 50 µs of render thread per epoch. LLF is there, and the others are not:

-   **Upload recording:** about 20 µs per epoch of driver command recording. Moving it off the render thread
    needs either the producers to record their batches' copies themselves, or a latched copy table run by a
    pre-recorded GPU copy dispatch.
-   **Worker joins:** 0-60 µs, varying by run. The colour and shadow jobs finish just in time on average. Track
    T's work (persistent object slots, GPU-driven candidates) shortens them.
-   **The skip set (`drawnFrame`):** 9 µs per main commit, a geometry-keyed map the render thread updates. It
    has four readers across frames.
-   **ORG's own share:** about 10 µs (checks, releases, submit).

Gates met on this path:

-   probe 0 differ for the colour, Z-prepass and scene jobs;
-   BuildDraws and decal parity OK;
-   capture parity at its known residue;
-   0 claimed but not drawn;
-   save/load and the toggle clean;
-   0 ticket waits in steady state;
-   ORG's tests pass.

## Holes on alpha-tested objects

The symptom: alpha-tested objects (roofs, foliage, thickets, ferns) vanished for a frame at a time, now and
then when the camera was still and often while it moved. When DCLF's uploads were broken and it drew nothing,
the same objects instead popped into the native frame. That pointed at ownership (which of the two draws an
object in a given frame) rather than at a draw going wrong.

### The instruments

-   **`CS_DCLF_SET_PARITY=1`, per object, every frame.** BuildDraws keeps two bits in each object's
    visibility word, below a 28-bit stamp: "the depth segment appended a draw" and "the colour segment
    appended a draw". Decals mark their colour draw too. After the colour epoch the words are copied through
    a D3D11 view into a staging ring. A few frames later each object is classified against a snapshot of the
    CPU side: each build's per-object state (`MainPayload::objectState`: drawable, cull-only, or its skip
    reason), and whether the object was claimed and withheld from the native loop. The report counts
    depth-without-colour, colour-without-depth, and withheld-but-drawn-by-nobody, with named samples.
-   **The hole report, always on.** "Claimed but not drawn" used to be a snapshot of the report's last frame,
    so intermittent holes never showed. It now accumulates over the interval and logs samples. Each sample
    gives the object's reason: SceneStore now records the accumulate phase's per-frame verdict
    (`Tracked::accumulateReason`, `SceneStore::ReasonThisFrame`).
-   **`CS_DCLF_TEST_TURN="<start>:<end>:<degrees per frame>"`.** Turns the player every frame, so a
    scripted run has steady camera motion. The standard script had none.

### What they found

With the camera turning (1.5° per frame) in all three scenes:

-   **Depth and colour agree exactly.** Depth without colour and colour without depth were 0 in every
    interval.
-   **Holes were frequent,** and almost all had one cause, `alpha-test-state`:

| scene, turning | holes per 300 frames | frames with holes | reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| exterior | 685 | 192 | `alpha-test-state` 683 |
| Dragonsreach | 397 | 100 | `alpha-test-state` 397 |
| Riverwood | 1061 | 244 | `alpha-test-state` 1061 |

The accumulate phase left a pass native when it sat in an alpha-test batch list (1, 3, 4) and its registered
technique lacked DoAlphaTest. The claims, though, are last frame's colour draws, and withholding happens at
registration. So when an object DCLF drew last frame came in this frame without the bit, the native loop had
already been told to leave it, and DCLF then declined it. That left a hole for a frame, and the reverse
flip let the native path draw it again.

### Why the bit comes and goes

Decompiled (engine notes, batch renderer): `GetRenderPasses` sets DoAlphaTest for alpha-tested geometry only
while the early-Z global is set, or the object is blended, or its `alpha * fade` for the camera being
registered is below 1. It keeps the build on the shared property until that state changes. The flicker was
seen on near objects too, not only at fade distance, so which rebuild decides the bit in a given frame is not
settled. The fix below does not depend on it: what the native frame shows does not depend on the bit, since
the list alone decides alpha testing, and the main pass tests EQUAL against an alpha-tested prepass.

### The fixes

-   **`DrawnPassDescriptor`.** Every pass in lists 1, 3 and 4 is taken with DoAlphaTest. This applies at
    both capture sites, the capture comparison and capture parity's native side. `DO_ALPHA_TEST` adds only
    the discard, so coverage matches the native frame, and these objects are now DCLF's in every frame.
    The `alpha-test-state` reason is gone.
-   **Fading is decided once, at registration.** `PassCapture::FadingAtRegistration` feeds both the
    withholding (a fading object is not withheld) and the accumulate phase's fading verdict
    (`AccumulatedPass::fading`), where the verdict used to re-read the fade node later in the frame.
-   **The hand-back.** At EarlyPrepass, once the tables and pipeline lookups exist and before the native
    depth and main passes draw, every pass withheld this frame whose object DCLF cannot draw goes back to its
    batch renderer through the original `RegisterPass` (`PassCapture::HandBackUndrawable`). That covers no
    bindings this frame, and a pipeline variant still compiling (three such cases in the first run after the
    normalization: `MineOreIron04`, `NorTowerRuinsRamp01`, `DeadSalmon13`). The hole detectors count only
    what was actually withheld and not handed back (`PassCapture::WithheldThisFrame`).

After the fixes, the same turning runs and a probe run with the toggle and save show 0 holes in every
interval, with depth and colour still in exact agreement. The user confirmed the flicker is gone. Capture
parity stays at its known residue.

The shadow-build probe differs more often while turning (up to about 90 of 300 frames). The differing
bytes are always in the alpha-tested casters' texture-transform blocks: animated UVs read at slightly
different moments by the two builds (see "The scene walk starts at `Main::Draw`").

Still open: the hand-back runs a lookup for each withheld pass every frame (about 1700 in the exterior). It
has not been measured against the render-thread budget.

## Trees and actors

The objects DCLF was drawing as "trees" were the TreeAnim technique: shrubs, ferns and other animated
foliage. Real trees and actors still went through the native passes. `CS_DCLF_NATIVE_PROBE=1` found why.
It records every Lighting draw the main pass still issues natively, which under static ownership is exactly
what DCLF does not cover. For each draw it records DCLF's verdict, the base object's form type, the skin
shape and the pass's LODMode, and samples the whole ancestor chain.

Native Lighting draws per frame before this change:

| | exterior | Dragonsreach | Riverwood |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TREE | 190 | - | 83 |
| actors | 17 | 100 | 110 |

### Why they stayed native

-   **Every tree hangs under an `NiSwitchNode`** (`BSTreeNode` > `BSMultiBoundNode 'FadeNode Anim'` >
    `NiSwitchNode` > shapes), and harvestable flora (fish buckets, mushrooms on logs) under another. The
    tracker rejected anything under a switch node as `unsupported-parent`.
-   **Most trees are skins of two or three partitions**, one per LOD level (LOD bytes 1/0, or 1/2/0 with
    TreeAnim). The skinned path took exactly one partition, so the rest were `skin-shape`.
-   **Actor bodies and armour are `BSDismemberSkinInstance`s** of one to three partitions: `skin-shape`.
-   **Anything under an actor was rejected by a blanket Phase 1 rule** (`actor`), recorded as an
    assumption and never measured. Exterior actors also hang under the cell's Actor node, which DCLF did not
    walk.
-   Heads, hair, eyes, mouths and brows are `BSDynamicTriShape`s (`not-trishape`), whose vertices the
    engine rewrites every frame. They stay native.

### What the engine does (engine notes, "Skin partitions" and "Switch nodes")

-   A skinned draw is one `DrawIndexed` per partition the engine draws, each binding that partition's own
    TriShape. All of them use the whole skin's palette. Partition *i* is drawn when a constant table at
    `0x14202a030`, indexed by the pass's `LODMode` and the partition's LOD byte, says so. A
    `BSDismemberSkinInstance` first skips the partitions whose flag is clear.
-   A pass's `LODMode` is the fade node's LOD level (`+0x152 & 0xF`) for `kMeshLOD` geometry and 3 otherwise.
    The main-pass and shadow-pass builders use the same level.
-   While a `kMeshLOD` fade node's LOD state is not settled, `GetRenderPasses` adds a second, single-level
    copy of every pass (hint 10) for the cross-fade.
-   `NiSwitchNode::OnVisible` culls `children[index]` alone, and brings that child up to date there when it
    became the selected one after the last update pass.

### What was built

-   **Switch nodes** (`CS_DCLF_SWITCH_NODES`, reason `switch`). A switch on the path marks the leaf, and
    `ClassifyFrame` checks every frame that each switch selects the leaf's branch and that the branch is
    current (`SceneStore::SwitchSelects`). The scene phase re-takes this verdict every frame instead of
    caching it for 64, because the shadow views draw what that phase admits. The switch's own fields are
    read at their SE/AE offsets (`SceneStore::ReadSwitch`): CommonLib declares them after `NiNode`, whose
    declared size in a multi-runtime build is VR's, so its members read the wrong memory. The first version
    read garbage indices and rejected every tree.
-   **Skins of several partitions** (`CS_DCLF_SKIN_PARTITIONS`, needs `CS_DCLF_SKINNED`). A skin is one
    object whose draw writes one sequence per partition the engine draws:
    -   `Tables::skinPartitions` holds the mask (bit *i* = partition *i*). The scene phase sets it from the fade
        node for the shadow views, and the accumulate phase replaces it from the registered pass
        (`AccumulatedPass::lodRow`).
    -   Every partition's TriShape has a geometry slot, and the slots are linked every frame
        (`GeometryRecord::nextPartition`, packed into `GeometryDraw`'s spare word).
    -   `DrawInput` grew a word for the mask (44 bytes), and BuildDrawsCS walks the links.
    -   An object stays one record, one visibility word and one culling verdict; only its draws multiply.
    -   A mask of 0 (the engine draws none) is `hidden`. Up to eight partitions sharing the first one's
        vertex layout are eligible.
    -   The CPU templates, BuildDraws parity (sorted by object, then index buffer), the draw cap and draw
        parity all follow the same walk. Draw parity takes each native draw's expected partitions from that
        draw's own pass, so the hint-10 cross-fade copies are checked against what they really draw.
-   **The LOD cross-fade is a fade.** `FadingAtRegistration` includes the unsettled `kMeshLOD` state, so an
    object in a cross-fade is neither withheld nor drawn by DCLF until it ends, like any other fade. Before
    this, withholding would have swallowed the hint-10 copies too.
    Superseded by the split ("LOD cross-fades: DCLF keeps the object, the copy stays native"): now only the
    hint-10 copy is native.
-   **Actors** (`CS_DCLF_ACTORS`). The Actor cell node is always walked, and the toggle is `ClassifyFrame`'s
    actor rule, so it stays live. The FacegenRGBTint technique (body skin) is supported: it adds only
    `TintColor`, a PerMaterial constant the material evaluation already captures.

### Results

Same three cells, turning, with `CS_DCLF_ASYNC=probe`, BuildDraws, capture and set parity:

| | exterior | Dragonsreach | Riverwood (steady) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| native TREE draws a frame | 190 -> 18 | - | 188 -> 0 |
| native actor draws a frame | 17 -> 17 | 100 -> 22 | 110 -> 11 |
| claims | ~1465 -> 1546 | 920 -> 1099 | 1614 |

-   **Gates:**
    -   BuildDraws parity OK in every interval;
    -   draw parity 0 differing, and bone palette parity 0 differing;
    -   set parity: no depth/colour disagreement;
    -   0 holes, and 0 claimed but not drawn;
    -   colour and Z-prepass worker builds 0 differing;
    -   capture parity at its known residue (VS PerTechnique 13, one ulp, at the Dragonsreach cell change; the
        pre-change run shows the same 1,342).
-   The shadow-build probe differs in about as many frames as before (110 against 88 in the exterior), in
    the same texture-transform blocks.

What stays native, by name:

-   The dynamic head parts.
-   Actors and trees mid-fade.
-   **The player's own body** (about 6 draws). The engine sets `kHidden` on the player's third-person
    `Skeleton.nif` while `Main::Draw` begins, which is when the scene walk reads it, and clears it before the
    cull. The native loop draws it, and DCLF's verdict is `hidden`. That is correct and leaves no hole; it
    only means those draws are not DCLF's.
-   Distant LOD (`no-ref`, under `LODRoot`).

## Fading objects

An object fading in or out used to go back to the native passes for the whole fade. Most fades do not need
that. The engine draws them in the ordinary opaque groups (hints 0, 11 and 15) with the screen-door mask:
pass descriptor `AdditionalAlphaMask`, with the fade in `MaterialData.z`. `Lighting.hlsl` discards against a
4x4 screen pattern, so the object stays opaque, and the Z-prepass, which keeps the alpha test, dithers the
same pixels.

-   **`CS_DCLF_FADING`** (default on, live toggle) makes those passes eligible. `MaterialData.z` is
    `property.alpha`, which the material evaluation already resamples every frame at Prepass
    (`RefreshFrameConstants`).
-   **What stays native** (`PassCapture::FadingAtRegistration`):
    -   blended fades (accumulation hint 9, drawn with the transparent objects after the composite);
    -   every hint-10 pass: the stencil-dithered fade, and the LOD cross-fade's copy of the old level ("LOD
        cross-fades" below);
    -   fading decals (hints 2 and 3). Keeping these native is a precaution, not a measurement: the decal
        probe's state mismatches turned out not to depend on the fade.
-   Report line: `[DCLF] fading: N screen-door fading objects drawn by DCLF over M frames`.

### The flicker at a tree's LOD distances

Trees (trunks as well as foliage) disappeared for one frame at fixed distances, moving towards them or
away. Culling was not the cause: the flicker stayed with `CS_DCLF_CULL=off`.

`CS_DCLF_TREE_TRACE=1` found it. It follows every geometry of a TREE reference through the frame:
registered, withheld, accumulated, given bindings, drawn natively (`SetupGeometry`), drawn by DCLF. It also
samples the geometry before the scene walk and after the accumulate phase. On a 40-unit-a-frame flight,
100 to 230 accumulated tree geometries per 300 frames were drawn by nobody, always in the first frame of a
LOD cross-fade:

-   The fade node's state went from settled (`a4`) to crossing (`c4`) in the cull. At registration the pass
    was already fading, so it was not withheld and the native loop was meant to draw it.
-   The accumulate phase gave it no bindings (`fading`), so DCLF did not draw it.
-   `SkipNativePass`, the hybrid rule on the `RenderPassImmediately` call sites, then skipped the native
    draw. That rule skips any object the colour epoch drew *last frame* and that has a record this
    frame. It never asked whether DCLF could draw the object *this* frame.

The fix: `SkipNativePass` keeps the native draw of anything `DrawcallLimitFix::DrawableThisFrame` rejects,
meaning no record with bindings, or no built pipeline. That is the same test `HandBackUndrawable` uses, and
the two now share it. The report line is `hybrid (last frame): N native passes were kept because DCLF could
not draw their object this frame`. After the fix, on the same flight:

| per 300 frames | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accumulated tree geometries drawn by nobody | 98-228 | 0 |
| one-frame gaps of an accumulated tree | 98-228 | 0 |

The trace also rules out the other suspects: 0 switch changes and 0 bone or world moves between the walk
and the draw, and 0 stale record transforms. What it still shows is expected:

-   **Drawn twice**, 270-890 object-frames per interval: the frame an object becomes DCLF's again (its fade
    ends). The claims are last frame's draws, so the native loop draws it once more. It is opaque at the
    same depth, so this costs a draw and shows nothing.
-   **One-frame gaps the engine made** (0-12 per interval): small foliage the engine's own cull did not
    register for a frame (`reg 0`), with nothing withheld.

**Still open:** with occlusion culling on, the set-parity gap detector counts 94-1,572 one-frame phase-2
rejections per 300 frames on the same flight, against none with `CS_DCLF_CULL=frustum`. Whether those
objects were really hidden for that frame is not yet measured.

### LOD cross-fades: DCLF keeps the object, the copy stays native

The flight above is dominated by trees changing LOD level. Until now each one went back to the native loop for
the whole crossing, which is two hand-offs per tree per crossing. A hand-off is where the one-frame flicker
lived, and where the double draws are.

**What the engine does** (engine notes, "Skin partitions", from `BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry`):

-   The object's own pass is untouched. It draws the new level exactly like a settled object.
-   The hint-10 copy of the old level is different in two ways:
    -   it is drawn with a stencil dither: stencil mode `0xB`, reference `int(fade * 31)`;
    -   its `MaterialData.z` is scaled by the fade node's cross-fade factor (`+0x14C`).
-   So the copy cannot be one draw merged with the object's own, but the object's own pass needs nothing
    new.

**The split** (`CS_DCLF_LOD_CROSSFADE`, default on, live):

-   **`PassCapture::FadingAtRegistration`:** every hint-10 pass is native, and a crossing no longer makes the
    object's own pass a fade. That pass is claimed, withheld and drawn by DCLF as before.
-   **`SceneStore::AddAccumulatedPass`:** a hint-10 pass never stands for an object that has a pass of its own,
    so the partition mask is the new level's.
-   **`SkipNativePass`:** never skips a pass `FadingAtRegistration` gives the native loop. Otherwise the copy
    would be dropped, because DCLF drew the object last frame. The rule is general: the skip only applies to
    passes DCLF models.
-   **Capture parity:** does not compare such a pass against the object. It counts it as a "native-only pass
    of a DCLF object".

**Results** on the same flight (tree trace, culling off):

-   Native tree draws: 1,666-10,248 object-frames per 300 frames before; 0-2,758 after, and the 2,758 is the
    first interval, before the claims settle.
-   Tree object-frames with a native copy: 308-3,522 per interval, and every one of them DCLF's otherwise.
-   0 drawn by nobody, 0 holes, 0 claimed but not drawn.

**Gates** (async probe, BuildDraws, capture and set parity, on the flight):

-   BuildDraws parity OK, draw parity 0 differing, bone palettes 0 differing.
-   Set parity: no disagreement, and nothing withheld and drawn by nobody.
-   Capture parity: 29-112 mismatches per interval in `PS PerMaterial 22`, `VS PerMaterial 11` and
    `VS PerGeometry 5`. The same flight with `CS_DCLF_LOD_CROSSFADE=0` shows the same three variables at
    24-95, so this is a residue of the flight, not of the split. It is not yet explained.

**Still to do:** the copy itself, drawn by DCLF. The stencil reference has only 32 values, so it can be up to
32 indirect ranges, each setting the reference. It also needs:

-   a pipeline variant with the engine's stencil mode `0xB`;
-   a per-object scale for `MaterialData.z`;
-   an answer to what the stencil buffer holds at that point, and whether the native depth pass draws the
    copies.

It would save 20-35 native draws a frame, and only while moving.

## Material records from their sources

Capture parity on a fast flight still found stale material records: `TexcoordOffset` (VS PerMaterial 11)
on scrolling materials, t11 on character-lit materials, and `ParallaxOccData` on some PBR materials. The
cache assumed a record is fixed apart from a learned set of frame-global PS floats.

A first attempt inferred more of the same by comparing values. It marked a material "volatile" when the
rolling validator happened to find it stale, and adopted a float as frame-global when two materials held
the same value. It adopted a coincidental `ParallaxOccData` 0.7 into every material. After a time-of-day
step it re-evaluated 190-260 materials a frame. It was reverted.

What replaced it is a deterministic account of every input. The engine notes' table ("SetupMaterial: where
every material constant comes from") lists each constant and texture `BSLightingShader::SetupMaterial`
writes, and where it comes from. `MaterialSources` keeps each kind of input current by its own rule:

| Input | Rule | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The material's own fields | re-evaluated when something writes the material | `ProcessMaterialWrites`, end of the accumulate phase |
| `TexcoordOffset` | computed every frame from the material's two texture-transform buffers at the engine's selector | `RefreshTextureTransforms`, end of the accumulate phase (the Z-prepass reads it) |
| Shader object and globals: `IBLParams`, PS 6, `SnowRimLightParameters`, `CharacterLightParams`, `LODTexParams.z`, `LandscapeTexture5to6IsSnow.zw` | one live evaluation per signature (the pass flags that decide which of them are written), copied into every record with that signature | `RefreshFrameMaterials`, Prepass |
| t11 (the character light's render target) | with the frame components; a change gives the record a new version | the same |

**The write events.** Hooks push the written material into a bounded lock-free ring. Every producer is a
hook, on any thread. The accumulate phase drains the ring and handles each written material:

-   a slot drawn this frame is re-evaluated;
-   any other slot of it is dropped, as is its cache entry, so its next use evaluates it afresh.

An overflowing ring treats every material as written. The producers:

-   `BSLightingShaderPropertyFloatController::Update` and `ColorController::Update` (vtable slot 0x27),
    except the types that write the property rather than the material, and the texture-transform types.
    The UShort controller's `Update` is `ret`.
-   `CopyMembers`, `OnLoadTextureSet`, `ClearTextures` and `ReceiveValuesFromRootMaterial` on the 14
    engine material vtables. The vtable IDs were checked against the decompiled functions.
-   CS's own writers, which call `MaterialSources::NoteWritten`: the PBR materials' overrides and their data
    mutators (`ApplyTextureSetData`, `ApplyMaterialObjectData`, `ClearMaterialObjectData`, `LoadBinary`),
    and `TESObjectLAND_SetupMaterial`, which writes the landscape material after `SetMaterial`'s copy.
    `ApplyMaterialObjectData` was the `ParallaxOccData` writer: TruePBR stores the projected material's
    roughness and specular level there.

**The build** repacks the frame-sourced floats into a reused (material, pipeline) group without a new
version: PS as before, and now VS (`materialPatchedVSFloats`) for `TexcoordOffset`. The colour kick and the
Z-prepass kick bring the known material textures up to date first (`RefreshKnownMaterialTextures`), so a
changed t11 index does not leave a pre-built job stale.

**The alarm.** The rolling validator (8 records a frame) and `CS_DCLF_MATERIAL_CACHE=probe` compare a
record with a live evaluation outside its frame-sourced components. They only report
(`STALE material record ...: a writer the material events do not cover`). They do not repair: repairing is
what hid the missing events before.

**Found on the way:** the shadow build read the texture transform's buffer 0. It now reads the buffer the
frame reads (`textureTransformCurrentBuffer`), as `BSUtilityShader::SetupMaterial` does.

**Results:**

-   The flight gate: capture parity 0 material mismatches in every interval (before: 29-112 an interval in
    `TexcoordOffset`, t11 and `ParallaxOccData`), 0 stale-material alarms. BuildDraws parity OK, draw parity
    0, holes 0.
-   Z-prepass staleness is back to its level before this work (64-188 inline builds an interval, from the
    290 of 300 the per-frame t11 caused).
-   Three `set gamehour` steps with ownership off, every draw compared: about 483,000 draws checked an
    interval, 0 mismatched.
-   Capture parity's "MISMATCH" label on the flight now comes only from "untracked eligible", which is older
    and separate (see "Scene events before the walk").
-   `WindTimers.y` is not compared: `SetupGeometry` copies a tree node's current timer over its previous one
    after every native draw, and `Lighting.hlsl` never reads the value.

## Scene events before the walk

Capture parity counted 23-1,365 "untracked eligible" draws an interval on the flight, only while cells
loaded. These are native draws of statically eligible geometry under a known category node that DCLF did not
track. The `ObjectLODRoot` trees are counted separately, as "outside the tracked category nodes".

**The trace.** Capture parity now follows each such geometry until it is tracked. It records when it was
first drawn untracked, on how many frames, and what tracked it in the end: the attach event, a category node
the refresh found new, or the rescan after a load. `SceneStore` stamps the frame and the source on every new
tracked entry, and the frame and the refresh's cause on every new category node. On the flight, every one was
drawn untracked on exactly one frame and tracked by its attach event at that frame's Present. None stayed
untracked, and no category node was found late.

**The cause.** The attach events were applied only at Present (`DrawcallLimitFix::Reset`). A cell attached
during the world update was drawn natively on its first frame and joined the tables on the next. The native
loop drew it, so there was no hole, but it was a handoff to native.

**The fix.** `BeginSceneFrame` applies the queued events (`SceneStore::ProcessEvents`) before the walk. The
scene graph is final from `Main::Draw` on. Nothing of DCLF's is in flight there, as after `Reset`. `Reset`
still applies them every Present, in menus too, so the queue cannot grow while the world is not rendered.

**Result:** 0 untracked eligible in every interval of the flight gate, with BuildDraws parity OK, draw
parity 0 and holes 0.

**Found on the way** (the first two are recorded for their PRs in
[bugs-found-by-parity.md](./bugs-found-by-parity.md)):

-   **A loader thread writes materials that are being drawn.** On some runs, the first interval had 8-13
    `ParallaxOccData` mismatches (DCLF 1, native 0.7), each on one frame. TruePBR's `TESBoundObject::Clone3D`
    hook applies a static's MATO in place, on the loader thread, to the materials of the freshly cloned model.
    Those materials are shared with references already on screen, and the previous owner is 0, so they are
    not forked. The write lands between the accumulate phase's drain and the native draw: native reads it
    mid-frame, and DCLF picks it up from the next frame's drain.

    Capture parity follows each mismatched material into the next frames' drains ("mismatched materials: ...
    written after its last mismatch"). A deterministic fix belongs in TruePBR: fork a material another
    property already uses before writing into it, rather than writing into it in place from a loader thread.
-   **`IsBeastRace` in the permutation buffer is sticky natively.** Subsurface Scattering's `SetupGeometry`
    hook sets or clears it only for face draws, so every later draw (bodies, hands, flora) inherits the last
    face's value. That is capture parity's occasional "permutation parity ... extra 4". DCLF's 0 is the
    intended value for those draws; the fix belongs in Subsurface Scattering (clear the bit for every other
    deferred lighting draw).
-   The materials line counts the last frame only, like the other "(last frame)" lines, and now says so.

## First person: the Z-prepass drew the world with the first-person camera

In first person nothing DCLF draws showed. Terrain, water, grass, distant trees and the first-person model
were drawn, and the objects DCLF draws were missing. Their shadows were drawn (the shadow epoch has its own
cameras). Every gate passed: capture parity, draw parity, 0 holes. So DCLF's draws executed and put nothing
on screen.

**The cause.** The Z-prepass ran where the engine's depth pass returns (`Main_RenderDepth`, `Main::Draw`
`+0x395`). In first person, the depth pass ends by drawing the first-person model with the first-person
camera and does not restore the world camera (engine notes: "The depth pass and first person").

-   **The Z-prepass captured that camera.** Its eye was `(0, 0, 120.5)` against the main pass's
    `(17120, -47226, 9.7)`, and its VS_PerFrame projection had the first-person near plane. It drew every
    object relative to the player's head, off screen.
-   **The colour epoch replays the Z-prepass's vertex inputs** (its eye and VS constants), so that both
    epochs rasterise to the same depth, and so it drew nothing either.

In third person the depth pass has no first-person block and the camera at the return is the world's.

**The fix.** On AE, the Z-prepass runs inside the depth pass, after the world's depth draws
(`Main_RenderDepth_WorldDrawn`, the call at `Main::RenderDepth` `+0x1AA`):

-   **The world camera is current there** in both views.
-   **It captures the engine's `kMAIN` depth** rather than the bound target, because Terrain Blending
    alternates the bound target with its own terrain depth while terrain draws. Afterwards it marks the render
    targets dirty, so the engine rebinds its own for the rest of the pass.
-   **The engine's own `kPOST_ZPREPASS_COPY`, at the end of the pass, now includes DCLF's objects**, so the
    copy `RefreshDepthConsumers` made after the pass is not needed on this path. Terrain Blending's blended
    depth is still built after the pass returns.
-   **The first-person model's depth is drawn after the world's**, which is the native order.
-   **The HZB, built in the Z-prepass segment**, leaves out the first-person model and the rooms' stencil
    draws. That means fewer occluders, never more.

On SE the offset inside `Main::RenderDepth` is unverified, so the Z-prepass stays at the end of the pass. In
first person it logs a warning once and still draws with the wrong camera.

**Result:**

-   The first-person save renders DCLF's objects: screenshots with DCLF on and off match.
-   Third person, reached by scrolling the camera back, is unchanged.
-   The gates stay clean: capture parity OK, draw parity OK, 0 holes, the colour and Z-prepass probes 0
    differing.

**Also noted:** the G-buffer probe's "after the z-prepass" depth slot reads `000000` whatever is drawn, so it
does not measure the prepass.

## Every DCLF draw sampled through an empty sampler descriptor

**Symptom:** the road by the large tree was lit as if in direct sunlight with DCLF on, much brighter than
native (screenshot mean 175.6 against 110.3). It looked like broken shadowing.

**Tracing it back.** Every shadow input matched native at that pixel (the shadow maps with DCLF's shadow
views off, the engine's shadow mask, terrain and cloud shadows, the detailed shadow), and so did the direct
light. The G-buffer, averaged over a 64 x 64 block (`CS_DCLF_TARGET_PROBE`), did not: DCLF's albedo was 1.8
times native, and everything scaled by it followed. With the Lighting shader writing its intermediates
(`CS_DCLF_SHADOW_DEBUG_OUTPUT`), the road's BC7 sRGB base colour read 0.310 in DCLF's draw and 0.099 in the
native one: DCLF's sample was not decoded from sRGB.

What decided it, in DCLF's draw:

| The same texel | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SampleLevel(..., 0)` through the sampler | 0.308 (not decoded) |
| `Load` (no sampler) | 0.099 (decoded) |
| The shader's biased `SampleBias` | 0.308, identical to mip 0 |

The texture descriptor was right: the heap slot `GpuTextures` wrote differed from a UNORM view's by exactly
the sRGB bit, nothing rewrote it, and a swizzle forced on it showed in the draw. The sampler was not: a
biased sample identical to mip 0 is a sampler that neither filters nor selects mips, and on NVIDIA the sRGB
conversion is enabled in the sampler descriptor as well.

**The cause.** `GpuTextures::SamplerOf` passes the engine's D3D11 sampler with `BorderPreset::Custom` (it
copies the border colour). BasicRHI's Vulkan `CreateSampler` returned `Unsupported` for any custom border
colour without writing the slot, and ORG's `DescriptorHeapManager::CreateIndexedSampler` ignored the result
and returned the slot index. All 20 of DCLF's samplers were empty heap slots, so every DCLF draw sampled
without filtering, without mips and without the sRGB decode. Only sRGB textures (TruePBR's) changed
brightness; everything else lost filtering and mips.

**The fix, in the shared components:**

-   **BasicRHI (Vulkan):** a custom border colour is accepted when no address mode is Border (the colour
    is then never read) or when it equals one of the three built-in colours exactly
    (`VkCustomBorderIsExpressible`). A custom colour with border addressing still needs
    `VK_EXT_custom_border_color`, and says so in the log.
-   **ORG:** `CreateIndexedSampler` checks the backend's result; on failure it releases the slot, logs and
    throws instead of handing out an empty descriptor.
-   **DCLF:** `GpuTextures::Sampler` catches that, logs it once per engine sampler and returns no index, so
    the draws that need it are skipped rather than drawn through nothing.

**Result**, the road save, DCLF on against off:

| | Before | After | Native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Road (screenshot mean) | 175.6 | 111.6 | 110.3 |
| Albedo, G-buffer block mean | 0.388 | 0.240 | 0.216 |
| Diffuse, G-buffer block mean | 0.866 | 0.556 | 0.472 |

The trunk, rock and player regions are back to their native values too: they were darker only because the
exposure adapted to the bright road. The G-buffer block means still differ by about 10 %; the final image
does not show it.

## The far cascade: DCLF drew the wrong set of casters

**Symptom:** shadows on distant objects were wrong with DCLF's shadow views on. The sun's far cascade (slice
1 of `kSHADOWMAPS_ESRAM`) was 20-25 % clear against 46 % natively (`CS_DCLF_SHADOWMAP_PROBE=1`), and
`CS_DCLF_SHADOWS=0` matched native.

**Tracing it back.** `CS_DCLF_CASCADE_PROBE=1` compares, per shadow view, the casters DCLF's cull keeps (a CPU
replica of `BuildDrawsCS`'s `Culled` against the view's latch matrix; it agrees with the GPU counters) with
the ones the engine registered into that view's batch renderers, recorded at `PassCapture::Withhold`. At the
road save's far cascade, DCLF kept 1146 casters and the engine registered 660; only 396 were in both. The
difference had four causes, each confirmed against the engine and then in the decompile.

**1. The engine culls against a caster volume, not the orthographic box.** `BSShadowDirectionalLight::UpdateCamera`
(`0x141512230`) builds six planes from the main camera frustum's corners and the light direction into each
cascade's culling process (`NiCullingProcess::customCullPlanes`, `doCustomCullPlanes`), and the accumulation's
cull (`FUN_1414f0920`, via `FUN_1414bf9f0`) tests them on top of the shadow camera. DCLF tested only the
view-projection box, which covers the whole slice. The planes rejected 0 of the 396 casters both drew and 683
of DCLF's 750 extras - large, distant rock and mountain meshes no visible receiver can see a shadow from.
The descriptor's own `clipPlanes` are not the cull volume (four of its six planes are zero).

**2. The near plane rejected casters that clamped views pancake.** In a clamped shadow view (mode `0xE`),
`Utility.hlsl` writes `positionCS.z = max(0, positionCS.z)` (`RENDER_SHADOWMAP_CLAMPED`): a caster between the
light and the near plane still writes depth, at 0. `Culled` rejected every caster wholly in front of the near
plane. With ownership, those were claimed and withheld too, so 228 of the engine's far-cascade casters were
drawn by nobody - rock shelves and cliffs above the scene towards the sun.

**3. Casters without `kCastShadows` belong to the volumetric copy only.** In
`GetRenderPasses_ShadowMapOrMask` (`0x1414af030`), a property without `kCastShadows` in a shadow mode gets no
pass when the global byte at `0x142033498` is 1, and when it is 2 (volumetric lighting, as here) a clamped
view whose accumulator has the volumetric flag (`+0x12E`, which the directional light's `Accumulate` always
sets) puts it in `volumetricShadowUtilityPasses` only: drawn into the volumetric lighting copy, never into the
cascades. DCLF's rule modelled only the first case and drew these 804 objects into every cascade; 89 of the
far cascade's remaining extras were among them, mountains in front of the near plane that now wrote depth 0.

**4. The sun's and the spot lights' accumulators do not register decals.** The accumulator registers a
culled geometry through a table indexed by its render mode (`FUN_1414b2140`, table at `0x14332b020` filled by
`FUN_14147e2c0`); modes `0xC`-`0x11` go to `FUN_1414b2a60`, which asks the property for its passes
(`GetRenderPasses_ShadowMapOrMask`, vtable `+0x158`) only when the property has neither `kDecal` (26) nor
`kDynamicDecal` (27), or the accumulator's `drawDecals` (`+0x12C`) is set, or its `+0x12D` is set and the
property has `kZBufferWrite` (32) and bit 18 and the geometry's alpha blends. The constructor sets
`drawDecals` to 1, but `BSShadowDirectionalLight::UpdateCamera` and `BSShadowFrustumLight::UpdateCamera`
(`0x14151ac50`) set it to 0 and `+0x12D` to 1 on the accumulators they create. DCLF's rule modelled only the
bit-18 case, which `GetRenderPasses_ShadowMapOrMask` repeats, so it drew the decal overlays without bit 18 -
the `:8` sub-shapes of rock and cliff meshes, 35 in the far cascade and about 250 shadow inputs in all.

**The fix:**

-   **The engine's caster volume in the latch.** `BuildDrawsLatch` grew a six-plane block and a plane mask
    (the former padding word; 0 for the main camera). `ExecuteShadowView` copies the descriptor's culling
    process's `customCullPlanes` when `doCustomCullPlanes` is set, and `Culled` rejects a bound wholly
    outside any active plane.
-   **No near plane for clamped views:** latch flag `kCullNoNearPlane` (`CullFlags` bit 9), set for mode
    `0xE`.
-   **`ShadowReject::VolumetricOnly`:** `kCastShadows` clear while the global is 2. Such an object is not a
    DCLF caster, so it is not claimed, and the engine keeps drawing it wherever it does: the volumetric copy,
    and point lights, where it casts normally.
-   **`ShadowReject::DecalNoZWrite` covers every decal** outside the registration's exception (bits 32 and
    18, blended). The verdict is one per object for every view, and a paraboloid light keeps `drawDecals`
    and casts the decals without bit 18; left unclaimed, the engine still draws them there.

**Result**, far cascade at the road save:

| | Before | Planes and near plane | 1-3 | All four | Native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Casters both draw | 396 | 618 | 618 | 577-618 | 619-660 registered |
| DCLF only | 750 | 124 | 35 | 0-3 | |
| Engine's, withheld and not drawn by DCLF | 228 | 6 | 6 | 6-7 | |
| Slice 1 clear | 20-25 % | 9.5 % | 43 % | 45.6 % | 45.8 % |
| Slice 1 mean depth | 0.26-0.31 | 0.14 | 0.48 | 0.510 | 0.514 |

The last two columns are the readings either side of a live toggle (`CS_DCLF_TEST_TOGGLE=3000:99999`); the
scene drifts by about as much between two readings (the sun moves). The middle column is why the first three
are one fix: keeping the pancaked casters without the volumetric rule drew mountains at depth 0 over most of
the slice. The near cascade went from 53 extras to 0-1.

The engine's casters DCLF withholds and does not draw are not holes. They are one actor's parts (`WarAxe:0`,
`_Cuirass_1`, `MaleUnderwearBodyArmor`, its head parts) and a grass shape in the far cascade, and two parts
in the near one, and every one lies wholly outside the view's box: the actor at NDC y -1.02 to -1.04, about
130 units past the slice's edge, with its bones (the skin palette's translations) in the same range as the
bound. The engine registers them because its cull is the caster volume, which is wider than the box, and the
rasterizer clips them; DCLF's x/y test drops them first. What is left is in
[dclf-open-defects.md](./dclf-open-defects.md).

## Shadow views draw with the view's rasterizer state

**Symptom:** after the caster sets were fixed, the near cascade still stepped at a live toggle (slice 0 mean
depth 0.2678 with DCLF against 0.2699 native) while its caster sets agreed. DCLF drew the same casters
closer to the light.

**Cause.** Community Shaders' `ShadowmapCascadeRasterizerFix` (`src/EngineFixes`) swaps the engine's global
rasterizer table (`[fill][cull][depth bias][scissor]`) for per-cascade copies around each cascade's draw:
DepthBias 160, slope 3.2, clamp 0.015 for the first; 100, 3.8, 0.015 for the second. It hooks only the cascade
loop of `BSShadowDirectionalLight::Render`, so the volumetric lighting copy draws with the engine's own states,
which there cull nothing. Read off the context after each native view (`CS_DCLF_CASCADE_PROBE=1`):

| View | DepthBias | Slope | Clamp | Cull |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cascade 0 (`kSHADOWMAPS_ESRAM` slice 0) | 160 | 3.2 | 0.015 | back |
| Cascade 1 (slice 1) | 100 | 3.8 | 0.015 | back |
| Volumetric copy, both slices | 0 | 0 | - | none |

DCLF's shadow pipelines had no bias at all (a shadow key carried only the two-sided bit, so no state was ever
read for it) and culled back faces everywhere.

**The fix: pipeline variants per view rasterizer state.**

-   `ExecuteShadowView` runs inside the view's draw (from `FinishAccumulating`), so it reads the state the
    engine binds for the view: `EngineRasterStates()` at the renderer's fill, cull, bias and scissor modes,
    which is the cascade fix's copy while it is swapped in. `DrawPipelines::ShadowRasterStateId` registers the
    distinct states (bias, clamp, slope, cull) and names each with an id; the exterior has three.
-   A shadow pipeline key carries the id (`kRasterShadowStateShift`), and `BuildShadow` takes the state from
    it. A two-sided caster still draws without culling. The scissor is not part of the state: the pass is
    bounded by the view's viewport.
-   The views of a render mode keep sharing one input list, but an input names its caster's **key slot**
    (`Lookups::shadowSlots`, append-only), not a pipeline. `RefreshShadowLookups` resolves every slot under
    each state its mode's views use and keeps `Lookups::shadowMapRows[state][slot]`. Each view's latch
    carries the byte offset of its state's row (`BuildDrawsLatch::pipelineMapOffset`, the latch is now 208
    bytes), the rows are copied into the shadow latch block after the views' latches, and `BuildDrawsCS`
    resolves the draw's pipeline through the row. The main camera's offset is 0: its inputs name pipelines.
-   A caster is an input only when its pipeline is ready under every state its mode's views use: the claim
    withholds the engine's pass from all of them.
-   The winding is the state's too (`FrontCounterClockwise`, set in every engine state); see "Front faces:
    BasicRHI's `frontCCW` has D3D's meaning" below.

**Result** at the road save, the readings either side of a live toggle:

| | DCLF on, before | DCLF on, after | Native |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Slice 0 mean depth | 0.2678 | 0.2690 | 0.2688 |
| Slice 1 clear | 45.6 % | 45.6 % | 45.8 % |
| Slice 1 mean depth | 0.510 | 0.510 | 0.513 |

The slice-1 differences are within the drift between two readings. 0 claimed but not drawn; 1200 of 1500
views drawn (the 300 focus views are left native).

## Front faces: BasicRHI's `frontCCW` has D3D's meaning

Every rasterizer state of the engine has `FrontCounterClockwise` set. DXVK draws the engine's passes with a
y-flipped viewport (negative `VkViewport::height`) and maps that flag straight to
`VK_FRONT_FACE_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE` (`d3d11_rasterizer.cpp`, `d3d11_context.cpp`). BasicRHI's Vulkan backend
uses the same flip, but mapped `frontCCW` to the opposite `VkFrontFace` (BasicRHI `fc214cd`, "frontCCW
parity"): DCLF's main pass pipelines passed `false`, which under the direct mapping culled the engine's front
faces, and the inversion made that `false` right instead of the caller. It also made BasicRHI's Vulkan
backend disagree with its D3D12 backend, which passes the flag through.

The contract is now D3D's on both backends: `frontCCW` is the winding of the triangle as it lands on the
render target, clip space y-up, and the Vulkan backend maps it to the `VkFrontFace` of the same name
(BasicRHI `rhi.h`, `rhi_vulkan.cpp`, README "Backend-independent conventions"). DCLF passes the engine's own
winding: the main pass pipelines read it once from the engine's rasterizer table
(`DrawPipelines::Impl::EngineFrontCCW`), the shadow pipelines from their view's state. At the road save the
G-buffer after DCLF's colour pass matches native (`CS_DCLF_TARGET_PROBE`), and the shadow maps are
unchanged. SARP and BasicRenderer set `frontCCW` true for glTF content and have not been run under Vulkan
since; their D3D12 behaviour is unchanged.

## The volumetric lighting copy: only the volumetric-only casters

**Symptom:** Volumetric Shadows' copy of the near cascade (its mip 1, the nearer of the cascade and the
volumetric lighting copy per texel) stepped at a live toggle, 0.2565 with DCLF against 0.2609, after both
cascades matched.

**Cause.** `BSShadowDirectionalLight::Render` draws each cascade twice: into
`kVOLUMETRIC_LIGHTING_SHADOWMAPS_ESRAM` with flag 0x100 while the shadow global is 2, then into
`kSHADOWMAPS_ESRAM`. Both go through the descriptor's accumulator and batch renderer, but the mode's draw
(`FUN_1414b44f0`, mode 0xE's entry in the table at `0x14332b120`) branches on the flag: without it, the
Utility technique ranges and batch groups 1 and 9; with it, batch group 15 alone. Group 15 is where the
registration puts accumulation hint 8 (`FUN_1414b2a60`), which only `GetRenderPasses_ShadowMapOrMask`'s
volumetric-only passes carry. So the volumetric copy holds the volumetric-only casters and nothing else, and
those are not DCLF's (`ShadowReject::VolumetricOnly`, unclaimed). DCLF drew its whole caster set into both
volumetric views, filling far more of the copy than the engine does:

| Volumetric lighting copy | DCLF drawing it | Native |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slice 0: clear / mean depth | 23.7 % / 0.389 | 44.0 % / 0.594 |
| Slice 1: clear / mean depth | 23.0 % / 0.252 | 33.1 % / 0.346 |

**The fix:** `ExecuteShadowView` leaves a view whose target is the volumetric lighting copy to the engine
(`ShadowStats::volumetricSkipped`). Across a toggle afterwards the copy's slices, both cascades and both
Volumetric Shadows mips match within the drift between readings (slice 0 of the copy 0.4996 against 0.5006,
37.1 % clear on both; VSM mip 1 0.2091 against 0.2094). DCLF now draws two views a frame instead of four.

**Taking the copy over: measured, not done.** `CS_DCLF_VOLUMETRIC_PROBE=1` (TEMP, `VolumetricProbe.cpp`) counts
every Utility draw the engine issues inside each shadow view (`BSUtilityShader::SetupGeometry`) and times the
sun's CPU work. At the road save, Riverwood, Ivarstead and Winterhold:

-   The copy is 71-93 geometries a frame, one draw each (75-94 draws), all hint 8, all static `STAT`
    `BSTriShape` with `BSLightingShaderProperty` and no `kCastShadows`: mountains, cliffs, road pieces. None
    is also drawn into a cascade. The engine's draw of both views costs 0.025-0.039 ms a frame.
-   Their passes never reach `BSBatchRenderer::RegisterPass` (the `PassCapture` hook). `FUN_1414b2a60`, the
    shadow modes' registration, inserts hints 11, 7, 3 and 8 straight into batch groups 9, 1, 4 and 15
    with `FUN_1414f5090(batch, pass, group)`, a direct call; only the rest go through the vfunc. Claiming
    them needs a thunk at that call.
-   The sun's CPU, native against DCLF: cascade draws 0.29 / 0.76 ms (road / Riverwood, 690 / 2150 draws)
    against 0.025 / 0.075 ms; `Accumulate` (the cascade culls and registration, `FUN_1414f0920` per
    cascade) 0.17 / 0.44 ms against 0.22 / 0.54 ms; the full-frustum cull (`FUN_141511f30`) 0.04-0.05 ms.
-   With DCLF on, the engine still draws 94 casters a frame into the cascades at Riverwood, all eligible
    by the caster rule but not DCLF's yet: 49 `BSTriShape`, 45 `BSDynamicTriShape`.

So the copy is about 80 draws and 0.03 ms. Taking it over pays only as part of retiring the sun's
`Accumulate`, and that also needs the cascade residue above.

**DCLF draws the copy (2026-09-23).** This is the first step towards retiring the sun's native
accumulation.

-   **Tables.** A `ShadowReject::VolumetricOnly` object becomes a shadow caster with
    `kObjectVolumetricOnly` (`Records.h`), instead of `kObjectNoShadow`. It gets a Utility technique and a
    pipeline key like any other caster.
-   **One input list, two caster classes.** A render mode's inputs hold both classes.
    -   A copy view's latch sets `kCullVolumetricOnly` (cull flag `0x800`) and draws the flagged inputs
        alone.
    -   Every other shadow view sets `kCullCastersOnly` (`0x400`) and skips them.
    -   `BuildDrawsCS` drops the other class before any culling.
-   **Pipeline readiness per class.** The mode's `modeRasterStates` word keeps the ordinary views' states
    in bits 0-15 and the copy views' states in bits 16-31. A caster must be ready only in the states of the
    views that draw its class. A volumetric-only caster with no copy view that frame is no input, and stays
    the engine's.
-   **Claims.** A volumetric-only pass never reaches `RegisterPass`. `PassCapture::VolumetricGroupHook`
    thunks the shadow modes' direct insertion into group 15 (AE `FUN_1414b2a60` + 0xFF, `0x1414b2b5f`) and
    withholds it when the mode's claim set holds the geometry.
    -   The claim set stays one per mode. Its ordinary casters' passes reach only `RegisterPass`, and its
        volumetric-only casters' passes reach only the group-15 call.
    -   SE and VR: the call's offset is unverified, so `VolumetricClaimsAvailable()` is false there and
        the copy stays the engine's, as before.

**Result** at the road save across a live toggle, with 0 views not ready, all four sun views drawn a
frame, and 77-79 volumetric-only passes withheld a frame. The engine's draws into the copy went from
about 78 a frame to 0 with DCLF on.

| | DCLF on | Native |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copy slice 0: mean / clear | 0.5930 / 44.0 % | 0.5936 / 44.0 % |
| Copy slice 1: mean / clear | 0.3440 / 33.0 % | 0.3454 / 33.1 % |
| Volumetric Shadows mip 1 | 0.2620 | 0.2617 |

## Shadow-only casters, and the sun's entry rule

Goal: the engine draws nothing of the sun's own (see "DCLF draws the copy"). With DCLF on, the engine still
drew these casters into the cascades, all accepted by the caster rule but missing from DCLF's tables, which
held only main-pass-eligible objects:

| Class | Road | Riverwood |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Terrain blocks (`Block (x, y)`, `Ineligible::Technique`) | 37 | 41 |
| NPC heads, mouths, hair (`BSDynamicTriShape`, hints 0 and 3) | 6 | 45 |
| Hay under a `BSOrderedNode` (`Ineligible::UnsupportedParent`) | 0 | 7 |

(`CS_DCLF_VOLUMETRIC_PROBE`, the engine's cascade draws with DCLF on, by the scene store's verdict.)

**Shadow-only objects.** A walked object that fails main-pass eligibility only for a reason the shadow views
do not care about becomes a table object with `kObjectShadowOnly` (plus `kObjectNoBindings`), when the caster
rule accepts it (`SceneStore.cpp`: `ShadowOnlyReason`, `ShadowOnlyCaster`; `CS_DCLF_SHADOW_ONLY=0` turns it
off).

-   **Which reasons:**
    -   `Technique`: the Utility technique does not depend on the lighting technique.
    -   `UnsupportedParent`: a `BSOrderedNode` only orders blended draws.
    -   Not billboards: `NiBillboardNode` turns to the culling camera, which for a shadow view is the light's.
-   **Where it is skipped:** the accumulate phase and the main epochs skip it (not even a culling candidate),
    and so does the `CS_DCLF_ONLY_ELIGIBLE` parity mode.
-   **Claims:** the shadow claim set covers it like any caster.
-   **Result:** with DCLF on, terrain and hay no longer appear in the engine's cascade draws. At Riverwood the
    only class left is the NPC `BSDynamicTriShape`.

**The sun's entry rule.** The cascade culls walk only the entries of the full-frustum culling processes'
`objectArray` (engine notes, "The sun's accumulation"), so an object whose entry the full-frustum cull left
out is never a candidate, however its own bound tests. With terrain added, this mattered: 11 DCLF-only far
cascade casters at Riverwood, among them a volumetric-only `MountainCliff01` with radius 7,359 and a terrain
block.

-   **The rule, measured with `CS_DCLF_CASCADE_PROBE`:** it now also records the engine's hint-8
    registrations. Every process rejects with the same plane (2), at the reference root. The entry is:
    -   for a static reference, its reference root (the topmost ancestor carrying the geometry's
        `userData`);
    -   for an actor, the cell's container, never tested;
    -   for a geometry without a reference (terrain), its nearest `BSMultiBoundNode`.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   `SceneStore::SunEntryOf` caches the entry node per tracked geometry, and the tables carry its bound
        (`Tables::sunEntry`).
    -   `PrepareShadowInputs` copies every full-frustum process's planes (render thread, after the
        full-frustum cull).
    -   The build flags an input whose entry is outside every process (`kInputOutsideSunEntry`), and only
        the sun's views skip flagged inputs (`kCullSunEntry`), because spot lights share mode `0xE`'s
        inputs.
-   **Result at Riverwood's far cascade:** DCLF-only went from 11 to 2 (a dagger carried by an actor, and one
    more of that kind, pruned by the engine at a node below the entry), and engine-only is 43 (the NPC
    shapes, plus one volumetric-only mountain whose bound lies outside the view in x). The near cascade has
    DCLF-only 0.
-   **Readbacks** across four live toggles at Riverwood (off, on, off, on) match within the drift between
    samples, for example far cascade 30.9 % against 30.8 % clear and copy slice 1 60.1 % against 60.4 %.
    The far slices step twice during the run, at about the same time in every run and in native periods as
    well: a scene change, not DCLF.

## NPC faces: positions published by the engine's own writer

The last class the engine cast into the sun's views was NPC face shapes (`BSDynamicTriShape` under a
`BSFaceGenNiNode`): 6 a frame at the road, 45 at Riverwood. Their positions are `dynamicData`, written by the
face morphing jobs (skyrim-engine-notes.md, "Face morphing"). DCLF never reads it or takes its lock.

-   **Capture in the writer** (`FaceSnapshots`, AE only, `CS_DCLF_FACEGEN=0` turns it off). A thunk on each
    head's morph call (`0x1404334f3`) copies, on the job's thread, every face shape of that head into a
    snapshot as soon as the job has morphed it. A thunk after the stage's `JobList::Finish` (`0x1406d36fd`),
    when no morph job runs, captures the heads that want a first snapshot (new, rebuilt, never animated).
-   **One head, one slot.** A head's snapshots are a lock-free triple buffer: the writer fills its slot and
    exchanges it into `latest`; the walk takes the newest at its start. Every shape of a head is read from one
    slot, so from one job run: a head is never drawn from two updates. Under the engine's schedule the walk
    reads what the engine's draws read (frame N-1's morphs); if the schedule changes, it reads the newest
    whole head.
-   **Lifetime.** The walk alone creates, rebuilds (a head's shapes changed) and retires records. Writers find
    them through a fixed open-addressed table keyed by the head; a retired record is freed once a morph stage
    has completed after it, since no job spans a stage's join.
-   **In the tables.** A face shape was first `Ineligible::FaceGen`, shadow-only; it is now classified like any
    shape, with its positions as a property of the object (see "NPC face parts in the main pass"). Its
    positions go to a region of the epoch's positions buffer (a float4 a vertex, kept per shape while walked),
    uploaded only when the head's snapshot generation changed (about 3 regions a frame at Riverwood).
-   **The draw.** Shadow sequences are `ShadowDrawSequence` (84 bytes, a second vertex buffer view after the
    first); `BuildDrawsCS` writes them for the shadow dispatches (`kPhaseBitsShadowSequences`), with the input's
    `streamIndex` naming a `GeometryDraw` appended after the geometry slots. The shadow pipelines declare
    binding 1 when their layout reads it. The shadow pass declares the buffer as a vertex buffer
    (`BindVertexBuffer`, added to ORG's `RenderPassBuilder`), so the graph orders the uploads before the draws.
-   **Claims.** Face parts register at hints 0 and 3. Hints 11, 7 and 3 bypass `RegisterPass` as hint 8 does
    (`FUN_1414b2a60`); the same claim test now withholds them at their direct calls (`0x1414b2b29`, `b3b`,
    `b4d`). Before this about 540 passes a frame of claimed casters with those hints were drawn by the engine
    as well as by DCLF.

**The defect found on the way.** The first build broke the far cascade (0 % clear against 31 % native).
Bisecting showed it with face shapes dropped before any snapshot, slot or palette: face parts with the decal
flag (brows, hairlines) got `Ineligible::Decal` from the derivation, and `Decal` is the verdict the walk defers
to the accumulate phase with a record. So those dynamic shapes became ordinary casters without their positions,
and the second stream fell back to their own buffer: UVs and weights drawn as positions. A face shape is now
`FaceGen` or rejected, never deferred, and an input whose layout reads its position from stream 1 must have a
face stream.

**Result** at Riverwood across three live toggles: far cascade 31.3 % / 30.9 % clear with DCLF against 31.4 % /
31.0 % native, VSM mip 0 0.4996 against 0.4984. With DCLF on, the engine draws nothing into the cascades
or the volumetric copy; the only engine Utility draws left are the focus view's 9 a frame. Snapshot parity with
`dynamicData` at the walk (TEMP, `CS_DCLF_VOLUMETRIC_PROBE`): 27,600 of 27,600 equal, 0 layout mismatches.

## NPC face parts in the main pass

Face parts are DCLF's in the main pass too. Measured at Riverwood (TEMP, both pass sources agree, so every
face pass reaches `RegisterPass`):

| Face part | Technique | Pass |
| --- | --- | --- |
| heads | Facegen (4) | hint 0, list 0 |
| mouths | 0, alpha-tested | hint 0, list 1 |
| hair, beards | Hair (6), alpha-tested | hint 0, list 1 |
| hairlines, brows, some hair and beards | Hair (6), decal-flagged, blended | hint 3 (the blended decal group) |

-   **A face shape is a property of the object, not a verdict.** `Ineligible::FaceGen` is gone. A face shape
    (`Tracked::faceShape`, from its type and parent) is classified like any shape, every frame, and the walk
    gives every record of one its positions stream, whatever the verdict, a deferred decal included. Without a
    snapshot or a region it gets no record, and the engine keeps it. This is the contract that the shadow-only
    shortcut broke (the decal-flagged parts drawn without positions, above).
-   **One sequence layout.** `DrawSequence` is 84 bytes everywhere: a second vertex buffer view (slot 1) after
    the first, a face shape's positions or its own buffer again. Both main signatures and the shadow signature
    have the slot-1 argument; `BuildInputLayout` declares binding 1 when a layout reads it. `ShadowDrawSequence`
    is gone.
-   **Positions for every epoch.** The main epochs have their own positions buffer (`cs.dclf.face-positions`),
    with the same per-region generations as the shadow epoch's, uploaded at their commit on the render thread.
    The main payload appends the stream `GeometryDraw`s after the geometry slots (`AppendFaceStreams`), and an
    input that is a face shape, or whose pipeline reads its position from stream 1, is drawn only with them.
    The interior (no sun epoch) works from the main epoch's uploads alone.
-   **Techniques.** Facegen, Hair and Eye join FacegenRGBTint under `CS_DCLF_ACTORS`. Their constants and
    textures needed nothing new: the material evaluation runs the engine's own `SetupMaterial` (the tint and
    detail maps, the hair tint, the eye centres).
-   **Hair with ProjectedUV** is drawn without the projection: the engine reads another object's snow there
    ([bugs-found-by-parity.md](./bugs-found-by-parity.md), "The engine").
-   **Extended Translucency's material model** is per geometry: its `SetupGeometry` hook sets "use default" for
    blended skinned geometry, an explicit model from `AnisotropicAlphaMaterial`, or "disabled". DCLF had
    assumed "disabled" for every pipeline, which held until it drew blended skinned geometry (the hair decals).
    The rule is now `ExtendedTranslucency::MaterialModelOf`, called by the hook and by DCLF, whose main keys
    carry the model (`kRasterTranslucencyShift`, left out of `RasterStateBits`) and whose permutation is built
    from it.

**Advanced Skin** was left for its own step; see "Advanced Skin in DCLF's draws" below.

**Result** at Riverwood:
-   Capture parity (`CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=0`): OK, about 18,000 draws checked per 300 frames, 0 mismatched.
    Permutation, draw, light data and bone palette parity OK.
-   With ownership: 0 native passes kept, 0 holes, `CS_DCLF_BUILD_PARITY` OK in every report (sequences with
    streams included).
-   Shadow maps across a live toggle unchanged; 0 engine draws into the cascades or the volumetric copy.
-   Snapshot parity 35,400 of 35,400 equal.
-   The Sleeping Giant Inn (interior): 0 holes, BuildDraws parity OK, 0 native passes kept.

## Advanced Skin in DCLF's draws

Community Shaders' Advanced Skin (`src/Features/Skin.cpp`) binds four things for Lighting draws, none of them
through the engine's state. DCLF used to take all four from the frame capture, so every DCLF draw got whatever
the capture happened to see: one material's t71/t74, one actor's wetness.

| Binding | Set by | Varies per | DCLF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| t72, the skin detail normal map | `Prepass` | frame | the frame capture, as before |
| t71 (RFAOS), t74 (wetness texture) | its `SetupMaterial` hook, bound at `State::Draw` | material (FaceGen and FaceGenRGBTint only) | the material record |
| b7 `SkinPerGeometry` | its `SetupGeometry` hook, every Lighting draw | owning actor, per frame | per object |
| t75 | nothing | - | declared by `Lighting.hlsl`, never sampled |

-   **t71/t74: one rule, two callers.** The hook's logic is now `Skin::MaterialTexturesOf(material)`: nullopt for
    a material that isn't FaceGen or FaceGenRGBTint, otherwise its extra textures or the default black texture
    for both. The hook binds what it returns, and `ConstantEvaluator::EvaluateMaterial` stores it in the material
    record (`MaterialRecord::featureTextures`, registers `kFeatureMaterialRegisters`). The lookups resolve those
    views like the engine's t0-t15 (`Lookups::Material::featureIndex`), and the binding record names them for a
    pipeline that reads them. One change of behaviour in Skin: a FaceGen material without a hash key now binds
    black, as a material without extra textures does. Before, it left the previous draw's textures.
-   **The stand-in no longer leaks Skin's binding.** DCLF's stand-in `SetupMaterial` runs Skin's hook, which
    leaves the evaluated material's textures pending for the next `State::Draw`. A native draw that skips
    `SetupMaterial` (the same material as the draw before it) would bind them. `RunStandIn` saves and restores
    the pending binding (`Skin::GetPendingTextures` / `SetPendingTextures`), as it already does for the
    permutation data.
-   **b7: the actor's wetness, per object.** `Skin::GetWetness(geometry)` returns the owning actor's sweat,
    water wetness, height and water depth: zero unless the geometry's user data is an `ActorCharacter`. It keeps
    a fading state per actor and computes once a frame; later calls in the frame return the cached value.
    -   The walk resolves ownership once per tracked geometry (`Tracked::actorOwned`).
    -   `RefreshFrameConstants` (Prepass, the same frame as the main pass) calls `GetWetness` for every
        actor-owned object in the tables (`Tables::actorObjects`, `Tables::skinWetness`), while Skin is enabled.
        Every actor's fade therefore advances once a frame whether or not the engine draws it. Natively it
        advanced only on frames where the actor was drawn.
    -   With `DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW` it is a field of the object record (`BindlessObject::skinPerGeometry`,
        `DCLFObjectRecord::DCLFSkinPerGeometry`), which `Skin.hlsli` reads in place of its b7 buffer, so the
        binding record stays one per (material, pipeline). Without it, b7 is a per-draw block deduplicated by
        value, like Linear Lighting's b8.

**Parity.** Capture parity's `skin parity` line checks every native draw it compares:

-   t71 and t74 as bound at the draw, against the material record (draws of FaceGen materials);
-   Skin's uploaded wetness against `Tables::skinWetness`;
-   the geometry's actor ownership against `Tables::actorObjects`.

Bindless record parity checks the record's `SkinPerGeometry` against the tables.

**Result** at Riverwood, with `player.damageav stamina 1000` at frame 1500 so that the player sweats and then
dries:

-   Capture parity (`CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=0`) OK in every report: 0 mismatched. Skin parity OK: up to 215 draws' t71/t74
    and about 4,200-8,600 draws' wetness per 300 frames, 0 differ, 0 ownership differences. The wet draws (sweat
    or water) went from 0 to 1,200 per report after the drain and back to 0 as the player recovered, and the
    fade matched throughout.
-   With ownership: 0 native passes kept, 0 holes, BuildDraws parity OK, bindless record parity OK, all 42 SPIR-V
    programs ready. The same with `CS_DCLF_BINDLESS_DRAW=0` (b7 as a per-draw block, no missing pixel constants).
-   Every FaceGen material bound the same 16x16 view at t71 and t74, below the shader's 32-texel threshold, so
    the RFAOS and wetness-texture paths never run natively either. That is a Skin bug
    ([bugs-found-by-parity.md](./bugs-found-by-parity.md)); DCLF binds what Skin binds.
-   Feature binding parity still reports t26, t55, t81-91 and VS b7 differing within some frames. Those are other
    features, not Advanced Skin, and were reported before this work.

## The sun without the engine's registration (stage 3, M1)

DCLF draws every sun caster, but the engine still registered them. `BSShadowDirectionalLight::Accumulate` culled
each cascade and handed every geometry to the accumulator's registration (`FUN_1414b2140`). That built its shadow
passes, and `PassCapture` then withheld those passes one by one. The registration also sets the geometry's
`activeLightMask` bit for the cascade, which the main pass reads to decide whether the object samples the sun's
shadow ("The sun's accumulation", engine notes), so it can't simply be dropped.

**`SunAccumulation`** (`SunAccumulation.cpp`, AE only):

-   **The hooks.** It hooks `Accumulate` (vtable slot 9) and `FUN_140e28af0`'s two calls of the registration
    (`0x140e28bc3`, `0x140e28c89`). Each call site is verified before patching.
-   **Per sun `Accumulate`.** On its thread, it records the cascades' accumulators. For each one it takes the
    claim set `PassCapture` would withhold that accumulator's passes by: its batch renderer's render mode's
    (`PassCapture::ShadowClaimsForBatch`, the same test as `Withhold`).
-   **A registration for one of those accumulators, of a claimed geometry,** runs only the registration's
    early-outs and its mask write (`WriteMaskOnly`). No pass is built.
-   **Everything else calls the original,** so an unclaimed caster is registered and drawn by the engine as
    before, and M1 needs no frame-wide verdict. Under capture parity (`CS_DCLF_OWNERSHIP=0`) nothing is claimed,
    so everything registers.
-   **What else stays covered:**
    -   The volumetric copy's passes come from the same accumulators. A claimed geometry's copy is DCLF's too
        ("DCLF draws the copy"). M1 requires `PassCapture::VolumetricClaimsAvailable`, so the hint 8/11/7/3
        withholding it replaces exists.
    -   `PassCapture`'s per-pass withholding stays, as the backstop.
-   **Switches:**
    -   The menu's "Skip the engine's sun shadow culling and registration" (`CS_DCLF_SUN_SKIP`, default on) needs
        static shadow ownership.
    -   The diagnostics that need the engine's sun registrations (`CS_DCLF_CASCADE_PROBE`,
        `CS_DCLF_VOLUMETRIC_PROBE`, `CS_DCLF_SHADOW_PROBE`) keep it off for the run.
    -   `CS_DCLF_SUN_TIMING=1` times the full-frustum cull, `Accumulate` and the registrations.
-   **Open:** a skipped geometry misses `FUN_1414b2a60`'s `property->lastAccumulatedFrameCount` write, which has
    no reader found yet.

**Result** (`CS_DCLF_SUN_TIMING`, render thread per frame):

| | Registered by the engine | Mask only | `Accumulate` | … registration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Riverwood, M1 off | 2,580 | 0 | 0.69 ms (max 1.25) | 0.41 ms |
| Riverwood, M1 on | 330 | 2,260 | 0.47 ms (max 0.81) | 0.19 ms |
| Road save, M1 on | 200 | 780 | 0.20 ms (max 0.66) | |

-   The geometries still registered are the unclaimed ones, the same set the engine registered before.
-   The shadow-map and volumetric readbacks match the M1-off run within the drift between samples (far cascade
    29.2 % clear in both).
-   Main-pass objects with the sun's shadow mask are the same share of the engine-kept objects with M1 off and on
    (1,475-1,504 of 1,910-1,933).
-   0 holes, 0 claimed but not drawn, BuildDraws parity OK, over the road save and two teleports.

**M2**, a CPU replica of the engine's culls, was not built. The next section takes DCLF's objects out of the cascade
culls instead, which needs no replica.

## The sun's cascades without DCLF's objects (stage 3, entry exclusion)

M1 left the engine culling every caster DCLF draws, cascade by cascade, only to skip the registration at the end. At
Riverwood that was still about 0.6 ms a frame of the render thread in `BSShadowDirectionalLight::Accumulate`. The
exclusion takes DCLF's objects out of the cascade culls altogether ([dclf-gpu-driven-frame.md](./dclf-gpu-driven-frame.md),
"The principle").

**Where to cut.** The cascade culls walk only the entries of the full-frustum culling processes' `objectArray` (engine
notes, "The sun's accumulation"): a `BSTArray<NiPointer<NiAVObject>>` the full-frustum cull rebuilds every frame, which
nothing but `Accumulate` reads (DCLF reads only the processes' planes). An entry removed from it after the full-frustum
cull is never traversed by any cascade, so its whole subtree skips the culling, `OnVisible` and the registration. The
cascade processes set neither `cameraRelatedUpdates` nor `updateAccumulateFlag`, so no fade, tree clock or
`kAccumulated` state is lost with them.

**Which entries: `SunCandidates`** (`SceneStore::UpdateSunCandidates`, on the render thread at the end of the delta
walk). An entry (a static reference's root, or a terrain block's multibound node: `SunEntryOf`) is a candidate when
every tracked geometry under it (`rootDependents`) either:

-   is a table object, whose shadow the shadow epoch draws, or which the caster rule rejects; or
-   builds no shadow pass in the engine either: not a Lighting geometry, hidden, alpha-blended, fading, or an unselected
    switch child (`SunEntryAllows`).

Everything else (decals, billboards, non-`BSTriShape`, LOD, and so on) keeps its entry in the culls. The status is
judged again only for the entries a change touched: a dependent attached, detached, or gaining or losing its record or
its verdict. Any change bumps a generation at once. The immutable snapshot (entry and geometry indices) is rebuilt on
the next walk that changes nothing, so a cell load does not rebuild it every frame.

**Which of those, each frame: `SunExclusion`** (`BuildSunExclusion`, with the cascades' claims, on the worker when the
shadow build runs there). A candidate is excluded unless one of its table objects casts (no `kObjectNoShadow`) and is
not an input of the cascades' mode, so is not claimed. The exclusion is published with the claims and used once, by the
next frame's full-frustum cull, and only if the candidates' generation is still the one it was built for. Otherwise the
engine culls everything that frame (`stale`), which is also what happens during a cell load.

**The filter** (`SunAccumulation::ExcludeEntries`, a thunk on `CalculateAndDrawShadowCasterLights`' call of the
full-frustum cull). It compacts each process's `objectArray`, releasing the removed pointers. Each process keeps at
least one entry: the traversal's first entry sets the cascade's planes up (vfunc `0xB8`), and an empty array leaves the
process with the previous cascade's.

**The bits.** Removing the registration also removes its mask write: the sun's bits in `activeLightMask`, which the
main pass reads for ShadowDir and DefShadow. DCLF writes them where they are read:

-   When the main camera registers a geometry under a removed entry (the same `FUN_140e28af0` call sites M1 thunks, on
    the registration jobs), DCLF ORs in the bit of every cascade its world bound meets, before `GetRenderPasses` runs.
-   The planes are the engine's own for that cascade: copied from the cascade culling process right after its cull
    (a thunk on `FUN_1414bf320`'s call of `FUN_140e305c0`), with the custom planes when it has them. The cascade and
    its bit come from a thunk on `Accumulate`'s call of `FUN_1414f0920`.
-   **The main registration reads the mask and then clears it** (the main accumulators' `+0x160` is `0xFFFF`), so every
    later registration in the frame, such as the reflections and the depth accumulations, reads 0. DCLF follows that:
    it writes a geometry's bits until the geometry's first `0xFFFF` registration (a per-geometry stamp), and only from
    the end of the sun's `Accumulate` until `Main::Draw`'s mask clear (`FUN_1414cb640`) returns. Without the stamp, a
    fifth of the comparisons below differed.

This is the Geometric rule (stage 3's decisions): each geometry's own bound against the cascade, where the engine
tests the nodes above it as well.

**The dry run** (`CS_DCLF_SUN_EXCLUDE=probe`): the exclusion is built and the entries marked, but nothing is removed.
The engine's bits at the main registration are compared with DCLF's, and every cascade registration the engine makes
under a would-be-removed entry is counted by whether it built a pass (`PassCapture::PassesOnThisThread`).

| Scene | Bits compared per frame | Agree | Engine only | DCLF only | Unclaimed registrations that built a pass |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Riverwood | about 2,500 | 99.99 % | 0.2-0.4 | 0.03 | 0 (205 a frame built none) |
| Whiterun | about 750 | 99.8 % | 0.5-1.0 | 0.3-0.6 | 0 (85 a frame built none) |

The differences, by class:

-   **Clouds** (`CloudDistant*`): effect-shader geometry, so nothing reads the bits.
-   **Distant cliff pieces, engine only:** accepted through a node the cascade tests as fully inside, whose plane state
    then spares the geometry its own test; its own bound is outside.
-   **Small clutter (fish, buckets, crabs), DCLF only:** in the far cascade's volume but not given its bit by the engine.
    DCLF's bit makes them sample the screen-space shadow mask, which is the more correct result.

**Result** (full featureset, `CS_DCLF_SUN_TIMING`, render thread per frame, SkyrimEngineTelemetry's coarse zones in both):

| Riverwood | M1 (exclusion dry) | Exclusion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Accumulate` | 0.59-0.65 ms | **0.10-0.11 ms** |
| … of which registration | 0.26-0.30 ms | 0.04-0.05 ms |
| Cascade registrations: skipped (claimed) / engine | 2,300 / 330 | 250 / 125 |
| The filter | - | 0.037 ms (1,358 of 1,450 entries removed; 4,494 candidates, all excluded) |
| Main registrations given DCLF's bits | - | about 2,330 |

-   The main pass's objects with the sun's shadow mask are the same share of the engine-kept ones: 1,501 of 1,908
    (78.7 %) with the exclusion, 1,485 of 1,893 (78.4 %) with the engine's bits.
-   Riverwood, `coc Whiterun`, `coc WhiterunDragonsreach`, `coc Riverwood`: 0 holes, 0 claimed but not drawn, 0 cascade
    registrations under a removed entry, 0 registrations before the cascades were known. The Whiterun load stood the
    exclusion down for 47 frames (`stale`).
-   What the cascades still walk: the actors (an actor's entry is its cell's container, never removed), the entries with
    a native caster, and the unclaimed ones. The full-frustum cull itself (0.044 ms, mostly jobs) still runs.
-   Switches: the menu's "Take DCLF's objects out of the engine's sun culls" (`CS_DCLF_SUN_EXCLUDE`, default on) needs
    M1's switch. Needs the delta walk (`rootDependents`).

**A crash this run found, not of its making.** `coc Whiterun` crashed in the engine's material database on a loader
thread, with or without the exclusion, and not with DCLF off. The material cache held its materials through a
`BSTSmartPointer`, whose release deletes the material directly. The engine's own release (`FUN_1414f7a40`, the
manager at `0x143187758`) takes the database lock and removes the material from the database at zero. So when the
cache held the last reference, the database kept a pointer to freed memory, and the next load whose material hashed to
it called into it. The cache now holds its references through `SceneStore::MaterialReference`, which releases through
the engine's manager (AE only; the cache is off on SE and VR).

## Skylighting's occlusion map, drawn by DCLF

Community Shaders' Skylighting renders a sky occlusion height map every exterior frame, through the engine's
precipitation occlusion machinery: `Precipitation::SetupMask` culls and registers the scene from an orthographic
camera in a new sky direction each frame, and `RenderMask` draws it (engine notes, "The occlusion maps"). At
Riverwood that was 0.43 ms and 0.34 ms of the render thread a frame, the largest native view left after the sun.

**No ownership exception is needed.** The map is Skylighting's own texture (`texOcclusion`), and nothing but
Skylighting's `Prepass` compute reads it. So when both features run, DCLF can draw the whole map instead of sharing
it with the engine: there is no residue to withhold anything from, and no claims.

-   **Coverage, measured first** (`CS_DCLF_SKYLIGHT_PROBE`, TEMP): every geometry that built a pass in this view was
    a DCLF table object, about 600 a frame at Riverwood and 240 in Whiterun; none tracked without a record, none
    untracked.
-   **One rule.** Skylighting's pass rule (its replacement of the Lighting property's vfunc `0x2D`) is now the static
    `Skylighting::OcclusionTechnique`, which its hook and DCLF's scene phase both call: the scene phase gives every
    table object its Utility technique for the map (`Tables::skyTechnique`, the keys in `skyKeysUsed`).
-   **The build.** The frame's shadow build lists the occluders as a fourth input list (`kSkyMode`, no mode bits: the
    technique already carries `RenderDepth`), with records for the alpha-tested ones even when they cast no shadow,
    and pipelines for the map's own depth format. No claims are built for it.
-   **The view.** In Skylighting's `RenderOcclusion`, when `DrawcallLimitFix::SkyOcclusionReady` (this frame's
    shadow commit uploaded every occluder, none left out for a pipeline or a texture not yet resolved), `SetupMask` is
    skipped. `RenderMask` still runs: with an empty accumulator it only sets the camera, clears the map and computes
    the projection Skylighting samples with. DCLF takes the view at its `FinishAccumulating` hook (render mode `0x1C`,
    the precipitation accumulator, `inOcclusion`): the matrices from `VS_PerFrame`, the viewport, the target (import
    of target 10 as Skylighting has swapped it in).
-   **The epoch.** `IndirectDraws::ExecuteSkyOcclusion`, right after `RenderMask`, in its own segment (`SkyOcclusion`,
    between the Z-prepass and Light Limit Fix's culling): the shadow passes over one reserved view slot (`kSkySlot`),
    frustum-culled on the GPU, into the map. Everything but the slot's blocks, records and latch was uploaded by the
    frame's shadow commit.
-   **The fallback** is the engine: a frame DCLF cannot draw (the first frames, DCLF off, the toggle off, an interior)
    runs `SetupMask` as before.

**The rasterizer state.** The first parity runs had DCLF nearer over up to 65% of the map on some frames, never
farther. The Utility shader sets the cull mode per pass (0 for a two-sided property, 1 otherwise), so the state left at
`FinishAccumulating` is the last pass's, which was two-sided: DCLF drew every occluder without culling, and the back
faces of large terrain and cliff pieces showed at low sun directions. The view's state is now back-face culling at the
renderer's fill, bias and scissor modes; a two-sided occluder draws without culling, as a two-sided caster does.

**Parity** (`CS_DCLF_SKYLIGHT_PARITY=1`): every 120th map is rendered both ways in the same frame, the engine's first
(`SetupMask` and `RenderMask`, copied), then `RenderMask` again and DCLF's (copied), and the two are compared texel by
texel. The same frame lists the occluders in DCLF's frustum that the engine did not register.

| Riverwood and Whiterun, 13 comparisons | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Occluder sets | identical, but one NPC's held axe (`AnimObjectAxe`) now and then |
| Texels where DCLF is farther (an occluder missing) | 0 in every comparison |
| Texels where DCLF is nearer | 30 to 900 of 262,144 (0.01-0.3 %), most by one step (1.5e-5); 0 to 290 by more than 1/256 |

The differences above 1/256 are isolated single texels in tree canopies: alpha-tested, wind-animated leaves.

**Result** (Riverwood, Tracy coarse zones, render thread per frame):

| | Engine | DCLF |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Precipitation::SetupMask` | 0.43 ms | not called |
| `Precipitation::RenderMask` | 0.34 ms | 0.022 ms (the camera, the clear, nothing to draw) |
| DCLF's epoch | - | 0.025-0.035 ms |
| `Main::RenderPlayerView` (inclusive) | 7.49 ms | 6.79 ms |

-   DCLF drew 300 maps of 300 in steady state (4,911 occluder inputs at Riverwood, 3,946 in Whiterun); the first 36
    of a session are the engine's, until the pipelines exist. 0 holes, and the live toggle hands the map back to the
    engine and takes it again.
-   The engine's precipitation mask (when there is precipitation) is still the engine's.
-   Switches: the menu's "Draw Skylighting's occlusion map" (`CS_DCLF_SKYLIGHT`, default on) needs DCLF's shadow
    views.

## The primary's cull without DCLF's objects (Phase 1 of the GPU-driven frame)

The main camera culled and registered every object DCLF draws, only for `PassCapture` to capture the passes and
withhold them. At Riverwood that was about 1.0 ms of cull and 0.9 ms of registration on job threads, and a 0.4-0.7 ms
wait on the render thread (`PreparePlayerView`). `PrimaryCull` takes DCLF's references out of that cull
([dclf-gpu-driven-frame.md](./dclf-gpu-driven-frame.md), "Phase 1, step 1" for the measurements it rests on).

**Where to cut.** The list processes' `Process1` (`BSGeometryListCullingProcess`, vtable slot `0x16`, AE `0x140e28390`)
is called by each list job for every entry after its first, and by every node's `OnVisible` for its children. It is
overridden, and filtered by process, because the vtable is shared with the sun's full-frustum processes and every
other list process. For an eligible entry it does, on the job's own thread, what the cull would have done, and the
entry's subtree is never traversed. That covers entries nested in multibounds too. Entry 0 of each list goes
through `Process2`, so it stays the engine's. (The first version filtered the lists on the render thread and put them
back after `Finish`; the decision, the fade calls and the list edits cost 0.24 ms of render thread, which the job-side
version reduces to about 0.02 ms.)

**Which entries** (per snapshot, `PrimaryCull::PlanOf`; the snapshot is the sun's candidates):

-   Nodes whose `OnVisible` is the plain recursion: `NiNode`, `BSMultiBoundNode` and `NiSwitchNode`, under a root that
    may also be a `BSFadeNode`, `BSLeafAnimNode` or `BSTreeNode`.
-   Geometries whose `OnVisible` is `BSGeometry`'s (the append to the process), at least one of which DCLF draws. Each
    geometry is DCLF's when the snapshot's per-geometry verdict says so: a main-pass table object that is neither a
    decal nor alpha-blended (`SceneStore::PrimaryEntryAllows`, `SunCandidates::primaryGeometry`; a change of any
    verdict bumps the generation). **Every other geometry is the engine's**, and is handed to its registration.
-   Admitted: the colour epoch drew every shown geometry of DCLF's in a frame the cull reached the entry in view
    (`Admit`, after the epoch, from `drawnFrame`). An admitted entry stays admitted, by node, across snapshots.
-   Frame preconditions: the sun's entry exclusion is live (its cascades are captured), and no local light cast shadows
    last frame (a synthetic pass has no point-light shadow). Otherwise, and whenever the candidates are stale, the
    engine culls everything.

**What stands in for the cull** (`StandIn`, per entry, on the job thread):

-   **The engine's `Process1` instead, for the frame:**
    -   a root that is fading or cross-fading LOD (`currentFade` or `fadeAmount` below 1, or `+0x153 & 0x70` not
        `0x20`: `GetRenderPasses` then adds the old level's hint-10 copy);
    -   a switch whose selected child is out of date (`childRevID[index] != revID`: `NiSwitchNode::OnVisible` brings it
        up to date with `UpdateDownwardPass` before culling it);
    -   an entry not yet admitted.
-   **The bound test** against the job's own planes, and the root's `kAccumulated` bit set or cleared, as `Process1`
    does (the tree clock reads it).
-   **The root's `OnVisible` update:**
    -   `BSFadeNode`: `FUN_14147a160`, or its own branch for LOD type 6;
    -   `BSLeafAnimNode`: `FUN_14147b110` and `FUN_14147a430` first;
    -   `BSTreeNode`: its height test (above the limit: nothing, and no recursion), the leaf update, and its LOD fix-up.
    -   A root that faded out draws nothing. One that starts to fade hands all of its geometries to the engine.
-   **Each geometry**, when not app-culled up to the root and when every switch above it selects its path:
    -   the engine's: its bound tested, then the process's `AppendVirtual`, in the traversal's order, so the
        registration jobs register it (decals keep their capture, order and native depth; effects and blended objects
        stay native);
    -   DCLF's: collected for a synthetic pass.
-   **After `Finish`**, on the render thread: the jobs' outputs are gathered, and DCLF's geometries have their
    `activeLightMask` cleared, as the main registration's `0xFFFF` would have. Not in the jobs, because the sun's
    `Accumulate` writes masks while they run.
-   **The synthetic passes** (`SyntheticPass`) are built on DCLF's worker (`primary synthetic passes`, about 0.09 ms)
    and joined at the accumulate phase, which takes them as if the engine had registered them:
    -   the derived pass descriptor;
    -   the sun's bits from the cascade test (`SunShadowBits`);
    -   the batch list, the hint and the LOD row.
-   A synthetic pass the colour epoch did not draw is a hole.

**The gates.**

-   A dry run (`CS_DCLF_PRIMARY_EXCLUDE=probe`) compared the synthetic pass with the engine's registered one for every
    object under a listed candidate. At Riverwood, 1,689 of 1,693 a frame agreed in every field; the rest are 2-3
    cascade-edge objects (the sun's bits, as in the sun's exclusion) and one blended decal, which is now the engine's.
-   The hole test covers the synthetic passes only. **The count of main-pass objects** (the tables report's "the
    engine also kept", which includes the synthetic ones) must match a run without the cut. It is what caught a
    defect the hole test could not see: CommonLib's `NiSwitchNode::index` is not AE's, every tree's switch read as
    selecting nothing, and 100 objects a frame went undrawn (1,793 against 1,894). The switch state is now read at the
    engine's offsets (`SceneStore::ReadSwitch`).

**Result** (full featureset, Riverwood, SkyrimEngineTelemetry's coarse zones, 20 s captures, ms per frame):

| | Off | Lists filtered on the render thread | In the jobs, with engine members, trees and switches |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary cull, job threads | 1.00 | 0.66 | 0.80 |
| Primary registration, job threads | 0.93 | 0.53 | 0.31 |
| Render thread, waiting on the primary's jobs | 0.69 | 0.45 | 0.30 |
| Render thread, DCLF's share | - | 0.24 | 0.02 |

-   Riverwood: 827 entries stood in for, 1,432 synthetic passes, and 153 of the engine's geometries a frame handed to
    its registration. The captured registrations fall from 2,360 to about 580.
-   Whiterun: about 700 entries, 1,176 synthetic passes, and the captured registrations fall from about 685 to 282.
-   0 holes and 0 not modelled at Riverwood, Whiterun and Dragonsreach (an interior: the preconditions keep everything
    in).
-   Main-pass objects 1,902 against 1,894 without the cut: the 8 are members outside the frustum under an entry in
    view, which the engine would have rejected and the GPU culls.
-   Sun-mask share unchanged, capture parity OK.
-   What still keeps entries in view with the engine, Riverwood (`CS_DCLF_PRIMARY_REASONS=1`, TEMP):
    -   516 geometries a frame under entries with nothing DCLF draws (effects), which the engine keeps;
    -   13 under `BSValueNode` and 12 under `BSOrderedNode` (in Whiterun, 388 under `BSOrderedNode`).
-   Switches: the menu's "Take DCLF's objects out of the engine's main camera cull" (`CS_DCLF_PRIMARY_EXCLUDE`, default
    on) needs the sun's entry exclusion and static ownership. `probe` runs the census and the comparison instead.

**Open:**

-   `BSOrderedNode`: it starts its own alpha groups, so its geometries' `AppendVirtual` group index is not the entry's.
-   Local shadow lights: the synthetic pass needs the shadow-light part of the light selection (`FUN_1414fcf80`).
-   Actors (one entry holds them all) and portal interiors (rooms are the entries, and their cull uses the compound
    frustum).
-   The entries not yet admitted because they have not been in view (about 2,250 at Riverwood) are still tested by the
    engine at their root bound.

## The sun's bits on the GPU (culling-job elimination, phase 1)

The synthetic pass was rebuilt every frame for one input: ShadowDir and DefShadow (descriptor bits 13 and 14) depend
on this frame's cascades (`PrimaryCull::SunShadowBits`). That input is now the GPU's
([dclf-cull-job-elimination.md](./dclf-cull-job-elimination.md), phase 1).

-   **The static rule.** `SunShadowStatic` is the bits an object takes when its bound meets a cascade: the
    accumulator's deferred flag, the alpha and fade conditions, the shadow passes and the global. A synthetic pass
    carries them, and `kObjectSunTest` (object flag bit 26) marks it for the test.
-   **The cascades.** The colour epoch's latch (`BuildDrawsLatch`, now 1,024 bytes) holds `sunState` (on, and the count)
    and up to four cascades' planes and custom planes, as `SunAccumulation` captured them from the engine's own cascade
    culls (`GpuCascades`).
-   **The test.** `BuildDrawsCS` tests every flagged colour input's bound against them (SunAccumulation's sphere test).
    On a miss it sets the top bit of the draw's object-index word (`kObjectSunMiss`).
-   **The shader.** `DCLFObjects.hlsli` reads the push word as `DCLFObjectWord` and derives `DCLFObjectIndex` (masked)
    and `DCLFSunMiss`. `Lighting.hlsl` reads its pass descriptor through `PixelDescriptor()`, which drops DefShadow and
    ShadowDir on a miss. The vertex descriptor never carried the two bits, so a draw is exactly what a pipeline without
    them would draw.
-   **One key for both sources.** An engine-registered pass of a geometry PrimaryCull draws synthetically takes the
    same static bits and test (`UnifySunBits`, on a frame the cut applies).
    -   Without it, admission was proven on the engine's pipeline (no bits outside the cascades), while the synthetic
        pass needed the sun-capable one, possibly not yet compiled.
    -   The first run found that: 175 holes over 89 frames after the shader cache was rebuilt.
-   **The gate.** At the sampled frame, the colour dispatch counts its flagged inputs and misses, and the CPU counts the
    same inputs against the same uploaded planes. The report reads `sun on the GPU ... <- OK`. They agreed exactly at
    Riverwood, in Whiterun, and through dusk (`set gamehour to 19.5`) and night (23.5):

| | Flagged draws | Missed every cascade (GPU = CPU) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Riverwood, day | 1,537 | 341-343 |
| Riverwood, dusk | 1,537 | 280 |
| Riverwood, night | 1,537 | 285 |
| Whiterun | 456-460 | 112 |

**Results:**

-   0 holes.
-   Main-pass objects 1,901 at Riverwood (1,894 without the cut) and 555-563 in Whiterun (555). Capture parity OK.
-   Pipelines 72-74 at Riverwood, against 88-90: the variants that differed only in bits 13 and 14 are one now.
-   The synthetic job takes 0.03-0.09 ms on the worker. The tables report's "with the sun's shadow mask" now counts
    sun-capable pipelines (1,838); less the GPU's misses, that is about 1,496 against the engine's 1,487.
-   Switch: `CS_DCLF_SUN_GPU=0` keeps the per-frame CPU rule in the synthetic pass.
-   The synthetic pass now depends only on the object and the frame's globals. Making it table state, updated on
    events, is phase 4.

## Visibility feedback: the stood-in roots' state from the GPU (culling-job elimination, phase 2)

The primary's stand-in updated each stood-in root's engine state inside the list jobs: the fade, the leaf and tree LOD
(`ServiceFade`, `ServiceTree`) and the tree clock's `kAccumulated`. That state now comes from the GPU's own
visibility, a frame or more later, on DCLF's worker
([dclf-cull-job-elimination.md](./dclf-cull-job-elimination.md), phase 2). What the frame draws stays in the jobs:
the bound test that picks the synthetic passes, the tree's height test, and handing the engine's members over.

**The GPU side.** BuildDraws' depth phase 1 writes, for every candidate whose bound is inside the main camera's frustum,
the frame's stamp into a per-object buffer (`cs.dclf.frustum`, `BuildDrawsConstants::frustumIndex`; 0 in every other
dispatch). This is the frustum alone: occlusion does not stop the engine's `OnVisible`. It is never cleared, because a
stale stamp is simply not the frame's.

**The readback, asynchronous** (as BasicRenderer's `CLodStreamingSystem` streaming readback):

-   A ring of readback-heap slots (at least 4, at least the frames in flight), each Free, Recording, Submitted or
    Decoding.
-   A timeline of DCLF's own.
-   The colour commit arms a Free slot for the frame (`ArmFeedback`), tagged with the frame's stood-in entries.
-   A copy pass after the main opaque draws (`FeedbackPass`) copies the stamps into it and reserves the slot's fence
    value (`ExternalSignalReservation`), which the framework signals after the copy. A copy abandoned before
    submission frees its slot.
-   With no Free slot the frame is dropped, never waited for.
-   A worker job polls the timeline and decodes every completed slot in fence order (`DrainVisibilityFeedback`).
    Nothing assumes one frame in flight.

**The decode** (`PrimaryCull::ConsumeFeedback`). For each entry stood in for in that frame:

-   **In view** (any of its synthetic members' stamps is the frame's):
    -   the root's update, `ServiceFade`, or `ServiceTreeState` for a tree;
    -   `kAccumulated` set, with an atomic OR (other threads touch other bits).
-   **Out of view:** `kAccumulated` cleared.
-   A root that starts to fade is seen by the next frame's stand-in (not settled), which leaves the entry to the engine.
    Between the two, one frame draws the synthetic passes: the latency the design allows.

**Two defects found on the way:**

-   **Freed nodes.** The first version serviced roots through the snapshot's raw pointers a frame later. On `coc
    Whiterun` a cell unload freed them first, and a later registration crashed on the damage. The tag now holds the
    roots (`NiPointer`), taken while the list jobs had just traversed them, and releases them on the render thread
    after the join, never on the worker.
-   **Wrong types.** `FUN_14147b110`'s LOD output is a float, and `FUN_14147a430` takes it in `XMM1`
    (`BSLeafAnimNode::OnVisible`, `0x14147ca3e`). DCLF passed an integer since leaf support began, so the leaf LOD step
    read a garbage level. Fixed for both the stand-in and the decode.

**Timing and placement.** Kicked right after the list jobs, the decode overlapped the registration jobs and the render
thread's wait grew by about 0.1 ms. It is now kicked after the synthetic passes' join (after registration) and joined
at Present (`PrimaryCull::EndFrame`), before the next frame's `Main::Update` reads the tree bits.

**Results** (Riverwood, full featureset):

-   Every frame armed and decoded, 0 dropped, 0 abandoned. Per frame, 827 stood-in entries, 826-827 of them in view by
    the GPU (the jobs' CPU test said 827). The decode takes 0.06 ms on the worker.
-   The tree clock: 39 stood-in trees in view a frame; 97-99 % of decodes see `+0x164` advanced since the last. The
    manager is time-budgeted, as it is with the engine's own cull.
-   0 holes; main-pass objects 1,916 (1,894 without the cut) at Riverwood and 555 (555) in Whiterun. No crash over
    Riverwood, Whiterun and Dragonsreach.
-   Render thread's wait on the primary's jobs, alternating captures on the same build: 0.395 and 0.376 ms with the
    feedback off, 0.399 and 0.375 ms with it on.
-   Switches: `CS_DCLF_FEEDBACK=0` keeps the services in the list jobs; `CS_DCLF_FEEDBACK_PROBE=1` (TEMP) reports the
    tree clock.
-   **Not built:** the fade parity probe of the plan (the engine's update against DCLF's on the same nodes). The decode
    calls the engine's own functions, one frame later; a parity of the state machines themselves would need a node
    both update, which the stand-in rules out by design.

## Switch selection by event (culling-job elimination, phase 3)

Which child an `NiSwitchNode` draws was a per-frame test in two places:
-   the scene walk, which re-read every entry under a switch every frame (the `kTraitSwitch` light path);
-   the primary's stand-in, which read every switch on a member's path in the list jobs, and left the entry to the
    engine when the selected child was out of date.

Both now follow events ([dclf-cull-job-elimination.md](./dclf-cull-job-elimination.md), phase 3).

**The writers** (AE 1.6.1170; every `mov [reg+0x12C]` in `.text`, [skyrim-engine-notes.md](./skyrim-engine-notes.md),
"Switch nodes"):

-   **`BSTreeManager`'s LOD selection**, in `Main::Update` (`FUN_140437e50`, five stores; `FUN_140438840`, two), and
    the local map's (`FUN_140438580`, one), on a tree's LOD switch (`BSTreeNode` `+0x180`). They leave the new child
    as it was, for `NiSwitchNode::OnVisible` to bring up to date in the cull. The manager can store twice in one pass:
    a level, then the far level.
-   **Harvesting** (`FUN_1401e8ef0`, from `TESObjectTREE::Activate` and the flora's) and **a harvestable's 3D setup**
    (`FUN_1401e9450`), on the switch under the reference's root. Both update the switch right after.
-   **`NiSwitchNode`'s own `AttachChild`, `DetachChild` and `SetAt`** reset `revID` to 1. That leaves the selected
    child out of date with no store to the index, and `DetachChild` clears the index when the selected slot empties.
-   Construction, cloning and loading happen before the node is in the scene; the attach covers them.

**The hooks** (`SceneStore::InstallSceneEvents`, `CS_DCLF_SWITCH_EVENTS`, default on with the scene delta):

-   The ten stores are patched with a call to an Xbyak stub, after every site's bytes are checked; if any site
    differs, none is patched and the switch events stay off. The stub saves the volatile registers, the flags (a store
    sets none, so the code after it may test flags set before it) and `xmm0-5`, and calls `SwitchIndexStore`. That
    makes the store itself and pushes an event carrying the index before it, when the value changed.
-   `NiSwitchNode`'s child edits are detoured (its vtable's implementations of slots `0x35`, `0x37`-`0x3C`) and push a
    structural event.
-   Only the render thread's writes make events (`switchEventThread`). A loader thread's are left out: its subtree is not
    in the scene yet, and its attach brings the switches up to date. Holding a reference to a node a loader is still
    assembling is not safe ("Resident entries", the crash).
-   The events go on a lock-free stack from the writer's thread. `ProcessEvents` drains them into one pending entry
    per switch, which keeps the index before the oldest event. A load screen discards them; the rescan's walk covers
    that.

**Applying them** (`SceneStore::ApplySwitchEvents`, render thread, before the walk's first round):

-   A switch in the scene whose index differs from its oldest event's value, or that had a structural event, is
    brought up to date. `CatchUpSwitch` is `NiSwitchNode::OnVisible`'s catch-up outside the cull: when
    `childRevID[index] != revID`, `childRevID.SetAt(index, revID)` (`FUN_140d29990`), then the child's
    `UpdateDownwardPass` (vtable slot `0x2C`) with `{ savedTime, flags bit 1 }`.
-   Every tracked entry under the switch is classified again.
-   The switch is listed for `PrimaryCull` (`TakeSwitchChanges`).
-   The attach and rescan walk (`AddSubtree`) brings every switch it passes up to date the same way. A newly attached
    switch's selected child is out of date until its first cull.

So a selected child is never out of date when the walk classifies it or the list jobs reach it. An entry under a switch
is no longer evaluated every frame for its selection: it drops the switch trait, and an unselected child no longer counts
as able to get a record (`PerFrameOf`).

**The primary's stand-in** keeps a per-member bit, `memberLive`: every switch on the member's path selects it.
-   It is read from the switches for a new snapshot, after a resync (a full walk or dropped events), and after a frame
    the cut skipped.
-   Otherwise it is read again only for the entries a switch event names (`switchEntry`).
-   The list jobs read the bit, and the stale-child fallback is gone.
-   `CS_DCLF_SWITCH_EVENTS=0` restores both per-frame tests.

**Validation** (full featureset, Riverwood, then `coc` to Whiterun, Dragonsreach and back):

-   Walk parity OK in every window (0 stale verdicts, 0 stale traits) and 0 holes.
-   `CS_DCLF_SWITCH_PROBE=1` (TEMP) reads the switches in the list jobs, as the old test did:
    -   0 members whose `memberLive` differs from their switches;
    -   0 selected children out of date.
    -   A few sightings in 300 frames are animated switches (fish buckets) whose own per-frame update runs alongside
        the list jobs, caught between its `revID` bump and its child's update (`revID` one ahead). The probe counts
        them apart: not stale.
-   The tree manager: 3.2 events a frame after the `coc` to Whiterun, 0.48 net changes, 1.7 entries classified again;
    none at rest.
-   `CS_DCLF_TEST_HARVEST=<frame>` (TEMP): the player harvests the flora and trees within 4000 units whose produce is
    switched.
    -   Eight harvests (mushrooms, egg nests, a fish): each an event, a net change and a reclassification, with parity
        OK.
    -   150 frames later the harness sets the same switches back to child 0 through the stub's handler, with no update
        pass, as the tree manager leaves a switch: the walk caught up all eight (`CatchUpSwitch`), with parity OK and
        the probe clean.
    -   The passes handed back to the native loop in those windows (147, 91) match a run with the events off (143, 84):
        records made again after a switch change, not holes.

**Cost** (Riverwood, four alternating 45 s runs):
-   The per-frame set is 1,057 entries, against 1,707 without the events (the light path kept 10, against 633).
-   The scene phase took 0.61-0.69 ms, against 0.66-0.84 ms without the events.
-   The event drain is unchanged (0.05-0.06 ms).
-   The ten stubs take 285 bytes of the SKSE trampoline, which went from 2 to 4 KiB.

## Resident entries (culling-job elimination, phase 4)

A stood-in entry still took its list job every frame: the frustum test picked which synthetic passes were built, and
each synthetic pass went through the accumulate phase, which restored it at the next walk. A **resident** entry needs
neither ([dclf-cull-job-elimination.md](./dclf-cull-job-elimination.md), "Phase 4 in detail").

**Its records persist** (`SceneStore`'s resident records):
-   Each DCLF member's record is patched once, from its synthetic pass, through the accumulate phase's own patch
    (`AccumulatedPass::resident`). It is not in `accumulatePatched`, so no walk restores it.
-   It keeps `kObjectNativeVisible`, so BuildDraws draws it whenever the GPU's cull finds it. There is no CPU visibility
    for it at all.
-   Each frame the accumulate phase only keeps its pipeline and material slots alive (`KeepResidentsAlive`: `lastUsed`,
    and the lighting template when no other object used the pipeline). `RefreshFrameConstants` resamples its shading
    with every other bound record's.

**Its list job returns at once** (`StandIn`, a lookup by root). The feedback decode services its root with the stood-in
entries (fade, LOD, `kAccumulated`).

**Joining** (`JoinEntry`, render thread, at most 256 a frame of each kind): entries the stand-in reached admitted and
settled join in `PrepareFrame`; entries not yet admitted join on probation after the list jobs (below). Either way:
-   any plan but `Rejected`: plain, fade, leaf and tree roots;
-   a fade root settled and not fading out whatever its distance (`+0x109` bit 0);
-   every member the switches select DCLF's (the engine's members keep the entry in the stand-in until phase 5), shown
    (nothing app-culled up to the root) and `ResidentCapable`: a record written only by events. That excludes faces,
    actors, animated shading and records written in full every frame. A kept skin qualifies: `AppendKeptSkin` writes
    its palette rows and partition mask every frame, from the same LOD row the synthetic pass reads, and a skin it
    cannot keep is written in full, which ends the residency;
-   every selected member's synthetic pass built at the join, without extras rows (projected UV, land blending), and no
    decal under the GPU's fade or height test (decals are never in the depth segment, whose first phase makes both).

Members no switch selects are left out of the resident's members; a switch change under the root ends the residency.

`ResidentRefusal` says why an entry was refused, and the report counts it by cause.

A refused entry is not offered again for 120 frames. The list jobs skip offering it (`joinBlocked`), so the render
thread's cost before the jobs is back to 0.003 ms.

**Leaving:**
-   the walk rewrites or releases a record (`WriteObject`, `ReleaseObjectSlot`, the slot check);
-   something is attached under the root or detached from it (the walk's dirty sun entry nodes);
-   a switch under the root changes its selection (`TakeSwitchChanges`; a resync compares every resident's selection,
    `SelectionSame`);
-   the decode finds the root fading, or its passes stale (below);
-   the new snapshot's plan or selected members differ;
-   a patch fails;
-   a probation join the build did not draw in full.

**Every resident leaves** on a frame the cut does not apply (a local shadow light, the sun's exclusion not live, the
menu toggle), and when the frame globals the static sun bits read change. A stale snapshot does not end residency.

**The walk parity** compares a resident record as the walk left it (its accumulated half reset).

**Defects found:**
-   **Joiners' passes replayed.** A frame that failed its preconditions returned before clearing the last frame's
    joiners' passes. The accumulate phase then patched them in a frame the engine culled everything, and the engine's
    pass won: about 2,000 failed joins at the `coc`. `PrepareFrame` now clears them first, and the accumulate phase
    takes them only on a frame whose residents are live.
-   **A crash while loading** (`rab7-off`, with residency off) on a `QueuedTree` background thread, in Havok's
    collision setup (`FUN_140ea5cc0`): a child with a null vtable under a tree's `FadeNode Anim`, whose child is the
    tree's LOD switch. The switch events took references to switches from any thread, including loaders assembling a
    subtree. They are now taken on the render thread only (`switchEventThread`). A subtree built on a loader is not in
    the scene until its attach, which brings its switches up to date (`AddSubtree`). It was the first crash with that
    signature, so this cause is likely, not proven.

**Validation** (full featureset, the tour Riverwood, Whiterun, Dragonsreach):
-   `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_PARITY=1`: every 60 frames each resident's synthetic pass is built from scratch and compared with
    the one it was patched with, and its record with the patch. 0 differ in every window.
-   Walk parity OK and 0 holes in every window.
-   Main-pass objects: in Whiterun 303 kept by the engine plus 252 resident, against 555 without the cut. At Riverwood
    about 1,110 plus about 800 resident, against 1,894-1,917 in other runs.
-   Riverwood: about 580 resident entries (800 records) of 827 stood in for. The rest are trees (39), entries with the
    engine's members, and records that need extras rows. Whiterun: about 180 resident entries, 252 records.
-   Whiterun's local shadow lights fail the preconditions a few times a window, and every resident leaves and joins again
    (about 1,300 joins per 300 frames). Lifting that precondition is phase 6.
-   Walk parity also caught a guard's shield or symbol kept hidden in Whiterun, with residency on and off alike. It is
    the actor-equipment class the scene-delta work met before, and is left open.

**Cost** (Riverwood, four alternating 20 s Tracy captures, ms per frame):

| | Off | On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DCLF's tables, render thread | 1.09-1.13 | 0.98-1.00 |
| of it, the accumulate phase | 0.43-0.45 | 0.30 |
| Render thread, waiting on the primary's jobs | 0.36, 0.43 | 0.38, 0.41 |
| The primary's list jobs (cull), job threads | 0.94, 0.98 | 0.93, 0.94 |

-   Synthetic passes per frame fall from 1,432 to about 630.
-   The list jobs cost the same: their time goes to the entries the engine still culls (effects, trees, entries with the
    engine's members, entries not yet admitted).
-   An earlier build offered every refused entry again every frame. That cost 0.02 ms before the jobs were queued and
    pushed their start back 11-20 µs.
-   Switches: `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT=0` turns residency off; `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_PARITY=1` runs the check.

### Step 2: admission from readiness (probation)

An entry the engine never showed was never admitted, so it stayed in its list job for good. Now it joins on probation.

**The join.** The stand-in runs the engine's `Process1` on a non-admitted entry, as before. When that leaves the root
without `kAccumulated` (out of view, or culled by the engine's occlusion), the entry is offered for probation.
`AfterListJobs` joins those offers the same frame: their records are patched in this frame's accumulate phase, while
nothing draws them. The root is outside the engine's view, and the GPU's frustum is the engine's, so no draw depends on
them yet.

**The admission.** After the colour epoch, `Admit` checks each probation join: when the build drew every member (its
pipeline, material and record were ready), the entry is admitted. Otherwise the next `PrepareFrame` ends it, before any
list job can return at once for it, and it is not offered again for 120 frames.

**The fade distance on the GPU.** Nothing on the CPU services a resident while it is out of view. When it comes into
view past its fade-out distance, BSFadeNode::OnVisible would snap its fade to 0 (FUN_14147a160: a root not visible last
frame does not fade gradually), but its kept record would draw it for the frame or two the feedback takes. So the depth
segment's first phase tests it:
-   **The distance** (`FadeDistanceOf`, engine notes "Fade distance"). The fade value falls below the fade-out
    threshold (`0x142032e38`) where the root's distance times the camera's LOD factor passes
    `(n + (1 - threshold)(f - n)) * divisor`. Here `n` and `f` are the node's near and far distances (`+0x128`,
    `+0x12C`) times `0x142032e48`, and the divisor is the LOD type's (`0x142032e00[type]`). Types 6 and 8, and the
    fades-off and LOD-updates-off globals, give no test.
-   **The row.** A resident fade root's objects carry the distance (`Tables::fadeDistance`, `kObjectFadeTest`), and
    the depth inputs carry it with the entry root's centre (`Tables::sunEntry`, which the walk keeps current when the
    root moves). The latch carries the main camera's position and LOD factor (`PrimaryCull::FadeEye`). `DrawInput` grew
    to 64 bytes for the row.
-   **The rule.** Past the distance and not in view last frame, the draw is dropped as a final verdict, so the colour
    segment and phase 2 follow it. The frustum stamp's bit 31 (`kFrustumFadeHidden`) remembers the drop, and a dropped
    object stays dropped while it is past the distance. One that was in view and drawn is drawn on: the engine fades it
    out over frames, and the feedback hands it over within a frame or two, the latency every stood-in root has.
-   **Validation.** A TEMP probe compared the CPU form of the distance with the engine's own servicing: 947 residents in
    view past it were all fading after the servicing, and none within it was. To get objects past their distance inside
    the loaded cells, a TEMP switch (`CS_DCLF_TEST_FADE_DIVISOR`) lowered the objects' divisor from this INI's 30 to 1.5.
    With `CS_DCLF_TEST_MOVE` and `CS_DCLF_TEST_TURN` carrying the player 12,000 units and turning back, the GPU dropped
    12 and then 119 residents in view. The witness ended every resident when the divisor changed, and holes and set
    parity stayed at 0.

**Stale passes.** The decode checks every resident fade root in every decoded frame, in view or not, and whether or not
its tag's snapshot is current (the tag holds the roots). A root that is not settled, whose LOD level (`+0x152`, the LOD
row) changed, or whose LOD metric crossed the specular or envmap fade end (`LodFadeStateOf`, when a member's derivation
reads it) goes back to the stand-in (`FadeWitnessOf`). The decode's own servicing is not the only writer: the LOD rows
that went stale in testing belonged to residents out of DCLF's view, which another view's `OnVisible` had updated.

**The frame globals** the passes and the rows read (`ResidentWitness`: the static sun bits, the fade globals, the type
divisors) end every resident when they change.

### Step 3: trees

-   **The height test on the GPU.** `BSTreeNode::OnVisible` draws nothing of a tree whose root is above the frame's
    height limit. A resident tree's objects carry `kObjectHeightTest`, the latch carries the base and the limit
    (`PrimaryCull::TreeHeightTest`; +infinity when the list processes' test is off), and the depth segment's first phase
    drops them as a final verdict. The decode does not service a tree above the limit, as `OnVisible` would not.
-   **The animation.** A tree's wind state is the tree manager's (`FUN_1404381e0`: it advances `+0x164` and derives
    `+0x15C` for the trees whose `kAccumulated` bit is set, which the feedback keeps). `KeepResidentsAlive` takes a
    resident tree's `TreeParams` and `WindTimers` from the node every frame (`DeriveTreeAnim`), as the accumulate phase
    does for every other drawn tree. Replacing the tree manager itself on the GPU is not attempted: its update is
    time-budgeted and runs under a mutex on the engine's side, and nothing else needs the cull for it.
-   **Skins.** Trees' LOD partitions are skins, and skins were not resident before. A kept skin's per-frame work is the
    scene half only (above). A defect this uncovered: the accumulate phase added every skinned object to
    `accumulatePatched` when it set the partition mask, including a joining resident. The next walk then restored the
    record while the slot stayed resident, which left it drawn by nobody. Resident parity caught 2,285 such records.

### Results (steps 2 and 3)

Full featureset, Riverwood and the tour, `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_PARITY=1`, `CS_DCLF_SET_PARITY=1`:
-   **Resident parity: 0 differ** in every window. A root fading at the moment of the check is not compared, and is
    counted separately: the next decode ends it.
-   **0 holes, and set parity 0** in every window: no depth without colour, and no colour without depth.
-   **Riverwood: about 2,150 resident entries a frame** (about 930 fade, 1,000 leaf and 220 tree roots; 2,990 records),
    against about 580 before step 2. Whiterun: about 1,200.
-   **The main pass's object count no longer matches a run without the cut, by design.** Probation joins entries the
    engine culled by occlusion as well as by the frustum. Those are culled by the GPU (frustum and HZB) instead of the
    engine: at Riverwood about 2,650 resident records are inside the frustum a frame, while the engine kept about 925
    of them. The engine keeps about 985 objects of its own, against 1,910 without the cut.
-   **Refusals** are almost all entries with an engine member (1,100-1,700 a window at Riverwood, phase 5), and passes
    the synthetic pass cannot build (about 300).

**Cost** (Riverwood, 20 s Tracy captures, ms per frame, render thread unless noted):

| | Residency off | Probation off | Probation on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Main::RenderPlayerView` | 7.07, 7.40 | 6.96, 7.28 | 7.95, 7.71 |
| Waiting on the primary's list jobs | 0.42, 0.47 | 0.38, 0.43 | 0.35, 0.32 |
| The list jobs' cull (job threads) | 0.92, 0.99 | 0.89, 0.93 | 0.74, 0.70 |
| `RenderBatches` (the colour epoch's join) | 2.24, 2.34 | 2.28, 2.35 | 2.79, 2.74 |
| `Main::RenderDepth` (the z-prepass epoch's join) | 0.56, 0.58 | 0.57, 0.62 | 0.89, 0.84 |

-   Probation takes about 0.2 ms of cull off the list jobs and 0.1 ms of waiting off the render thread.
-   **It costs more than that in DCLF's own build.** Both epochs' builds grow from about 1,830 drawable candidates to
    about 4,230. The worker builds take about 0.4 ms longer each, and the render thread waits on them (about +0.5 ms in
    `RenderBatches`, +0.3 ms in `RenderDepth`). The CPU build is per drawable candidate per frame, however few the GPU
    then draws. The fix is DCLF's, not the engine's: resident draws that persist across frames instead of being built
    every frame.
-   Switches: `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_PROBATION=0` turns probation off (residents are then admitted from a draw, as in
    step 1).
-   The build's cost is fixed by the persistent resident draws (next section).

## Persistent resident draws

The main epochs' builds wrote a draw input, a sequence template and a drawn mark for every drawable candidate every frame.
With probation that was about 4,230 candidates, and the render thread waited on it. A resident's draw input changes
only when the resident does, so each main segment now keeps its residents' inputs across frames.

**The region** (`ResidentRegion`, one per segment in its `BuildCache`):
-   **The inputs.** A dense array of the resident records' draw inputs, at the head of the segment's input buffer. The
    Z-prepass now has an input buffer of its own (`Resources::inputsDepth`), since each segment's region must survive
    the other's upload. The frame's own inputs follow the region, and BuildDraws reads both as one list.
-   **What it holds.** A resident record the per-frame loop would draw as one input with its pair's record. Decals
    (their slot is a per-frame ordinal), face shapes and second-stream pipelines stay with the loop, and so does
    anything past half of the input, draw or record capacity. The loop skips the region's objects.
-   **The records.** Each (material, pipeline) pair the region uses has a stable record slot (`records[0, slotCount)`).
    Its record is assembled there once per build, which is once per pair, not per draw. The per-object loop's record
    assembly became a lambda for this (`assembleRecord`). A per-frame draw of the same pair reuses the slot.
-   **The upload.** When the region's version is not the one the segment's buffer holds (`Resources::residentUploaded`,
    written by the commit that uploads it), the commit uploads only the entries changed since that version (`dirty`).
    After a resync it uploads the whole region.
-   **The rest of the build's output.** The region adds its sequence count to the draw capacity and its inputs to the
    dispatch count. Its drawable entries go into the drawn set and the per-object states, so the native skip set, the
    Z-prepass rule and set parity see them as before. The sun's CPU check covers its inputs too.

**What changes it**, and nothing else:
-   **SceneStore's change log** (`Tables::residentLog`, append-only). It notes a slot when the slot joins, leaves, is
    patched again or reset, when a resident's placement or entry root centre actually changes (`MoveObject`), and when
    a resident skin's partition mask changes (`AppendKeptSkin`). `Tables::residentSlot` says which slots are resident.
    Each region reads the log from its own position. One that fell behind the trimmed head (the log keeps about 64k
    entries), or whose tables generation changed, reads every resident slot again (a resync).
-   **A pipeline's set index changing**, or **a pair's record failing or recovering**: that pipeline's or pair's
    entries are written again (drawable only while both are good).
-   **The Z-prepass waits** for the colour epoch's first draw of a joiner (`drewLastFrame`) before its depth entry
    exists (`pendingAdds`): depth only for what colour drew last frame, as the loop's rule has it.

**Defects found:**
-   **The first change feed lost changes.** It was a per-frame list, cleared when the scene phase began, so a change
    noted outside the window between that point and the builds never reached the regions. Stale entries then drew a
    freed slot's old geometry at the slot's new object's transform: the player drawn as a rock and a plant, and
    mountains where the village should be. The region parity showed 3,788 entries against 2,297 resident slots. The
    append-only log fixed it: the regions then matched the resident slots exactly.
-   **The first build lost the device.** It is the same stale-entry defect, as far as can be told: it did not recur
    once the log replaced the list.
-   **Every change re-uploaded the whole region.** About 33 residents a frame move (their bound really changes), so the
    whole region (190 KB) went up every frame. Only the changed entries go now.
-   **A quadratic pending check.** The Z-prepass's pending joins were searched per log entry; they are marked per slot
    now.

**Checks** (`CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_DRAW_PARITY=1`, every 60 frames): each region entry is written again from the tables and
compared byte for byte, and every resident the region should hold is looked for. The tour (Riverwood, Whiterun,
Dragonsreach) gave 0 differences over 148,787 entry checks and 0 missing, with resident parity, set parity and holes all
at 0.

**Cost** (Riverwood, 20 s Tracy captures after `coc` at frame 300, probation on, ms per frame):

| | Region off | Region on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Main::RenderPlayerView` | 7.18, 6.44 | 6.33, 5.94 |
| `RenderBatches` (the colour epoch's join) | 2.40, 2.29 | 2.02, 2.05 |
| `Main::RenderDepth` (the Z-prepass epoch's join) | 0.72, 0.69 | 0.41, 0.45 |
| Colour build on the worker | 1.20, 1.13 | 0.89, 0.90 |

-   About 2,990 persistent inputs (3,410 sequences) behind 240 pairs at Riverwood; about 2,000 in Whiterun.
-   Both joins are now below their cost with no residency at all (2.34 and 0.58 ms), so probation's cost is gone.
-   **Still per frame, O(residents):**
    -   the drawn set and the per-object states the region hands the commit;
    -   the per-object records (`BindlessObject`) the build writes for every object, resident or not;
    -   the constants arena.
-   Switches: `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_DRAWS=0` turns the region off; `CS_DCLF_RESIDENT_DRAW_PARITY=1` runs the check.
