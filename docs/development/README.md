# Development Documentation

## Getting Started

-   **[VSCode Setup](./vscode-setup.md)** - IDE configuration, extensions, and auto-deploy
-   **[Shader Workflow](./shader-workflow.md)** - Fast shader iteration and deployment
-   **[OpenRenderGraph on DXVK](./render-graph.md)** - How features run render-graph work on DXVK's Vulkan device
-   **[DCLF architecture](./dclf-architecture.md)** - Drawcall Limit Fix as it is: the frame by thread, the data from engine events to GPU draws, ownership, the code's layout, switches and parity gates
-   **[DCLF status](./dclf-status.md)** - What DCLF draws, and what the engine still does on the render thread
-   **[DCLF open defects](./dclf-open-defects.md)** - Defects and failing parity checks under investigation, with their evidence
-   **[Drawcall Limit Fix](./drawcall-limit-fix.md)** - The historical record of how DCLF was built, with the measurements behind each decision
-   **[Skyrim engine notes](./skyrim-engine-notes.md)** - What the decompiled game binary does, where features depend on it
-   **[Crash catalog](./crash-catalog.md)** - Crashes met during development, their stacks and what is known about each
-   **[DCLF: a GPU-driven frame](./dclf-gpu-driven-frame.md)** - Investigation: what taking DCLF's objects out of every engine per-view walk would require
-   **[DCLF: object tables built from events](./dclf-event-driven-tables.md)** - Investigation: replacing the per-frame scene walk with persistent tables changed by engine events, the walk kept as a synchronous validation
-   **[Bugs found by parity](./bugs-found-by-parity.md)** - Bugs in other features (each a separate PR) and in the engine (with DCLF's rule for each) that DCLF's parity checks found

### Common Tasks

-   **Fast shader deployment:** `cmake --build build/ALL --target COPY_SHADERS`
-   **Full build with deployment:** `.\BuildRelease.bat ALL-WITH-AUTO-DEPLOYMENT`
-   **Validate shader permutations:** `hlslkit-compile` (see `.claude/CLAUDE.md` "Shader Development and Testing")
-   **Create a worktree with submodules + local preset:** `pwsh ./tools/new-worktree.ps1 -Name my-branch`
-   **Install optional git alias:** `pwsh ./tools/install-worktree-alias.ps1`

### Build Presets

-   `ALL` - Standard build (no auto-deployment)
-   `ALL-WITH-AUTO-DEPLOYMENT` - Build + deploy to game directory
-   `Dev` - Fast iteration preset (recommended for development)

See `CMakePresets.json` for all available presets.

## Worktrees

Use `tools/new-worktree.ps1` when creating a new worktree for development. The script:

-   Creates the worktree under a sibling `<repo>.worktrees/` directory by default
-   Reuses an existing local branch or creates a new one from `HEAD`
-   Runs `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the new worktree
-   Copies `CMakeUserPresets.json` from the main checkout if it exists there
-   Does not overwrite an existing `CMakeUserPresets.json` unless `-ForcePresetCopy` is passed

Examples:

-   `pwsh ./tools/new-worktree.ps1 -Name reproj_fixes`
-   `pwsh ./tools/new-worktree.ps1 -Name shader-debug -StartPoint dev`
-   `pwsh ./tools/new-worktree.ps1 -Name clean-build -NoSubmodules`

If you want a Git-native command, install the optional repo-local alias:

-   `pwsh ./tools/install-worktree-alias.ps1`
-   Then use `git new-worktree reproj_fixes`

The alias is installed into local Git config by default, so it does not affect other users unless they opt in.

## Build Targets

| Target            | Builds DLL | Copies Shaders | Use Case               |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| `COPY_SHADERS`    | ❌         | ✅             | Fast shader iteration  |
| `DEPLOY_ALL`      | ✅         | ✅             | Full deployment (auto) |
| `prepare_shaders` | ❌         | ✅ (AIO only)  | CI shader validation   |

With `AUTO_PLUGIN_DEPLOYMENT`, the plugin's own build copies its DLL and PDB to every deploy target, so building just
the `CommunityShaders` target deploys it too; `DEPLOY_ALL` adds the rest of the package. The deploy targets are taken
from `CommunityShadersOutputDir` when CMake configures and cached (`CS_DEPLOY_DIRS`), so a later reconfigure from a
shell without the variable keeps them.
