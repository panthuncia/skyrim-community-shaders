// NVIDIA Nsight Aftermath.
//
// A GPU fault reaches us as VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST and nothing else: no shader, no draw, no
// indication of which of several thousand dispatches per frame was the one that hung. Aftermath
// asks the driver for a post-mortem dump instead, naming the faulting shader and the last markers
// the GPU retired, which is the difference between "FSR-FG lost the device on a 1080 Ti" and a
// reproducible bug.
//
// Compiled out entirely unless the AFTERMATH build option is on (CS_ENABLE_AFTERMATH); every entry
// point below is then an inline no-op, so callers need no #ifdef of their own.
