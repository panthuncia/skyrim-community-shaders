	/**
	 * @brief The engine's own work for the sun's cascades, taken away where DCLF already draws the result
	 * (docs/development/skyrim-engine-notes.md, "The sun's accumulation"). AE only.
	 *
	 * M1, registration-free accumulation (toggle `skipSunAccumulation`, CS_DCLF_SUN_SKIP): the engine still culls
	 * the sun's cascades, but a geometry DCLF claims for the sun's views is not registered. BSShadowDirectionalLight::
	 * Accumulate culls each cascade and hands every geometry it reaches to the accumulator's registration
	 * (FUN_1414b2140, called from FUN_140e28af0). That builds the geometry's shadow passes, which PassCapture then
	 * withholds one by one, and ORs the cascade's bit into the property's activeLightMask, which the main pass reads.
	 * For a claimed geometry the thunks on those calls replicate the registration's early-outs and its mask write,
	 * and skip the passes. Everything else calls the original, so an unclaimed caster is registered and drawn by
	 * the engine as before, and no frame-wide verdict is needed.
	 *
	 * The entry exclusion (toggle `excludeSunEntries`, CS_DCLF_SUN_EXCLUDE; drawcall-limit-fix.md, "The sun's cascades
	 * without DCLF's objects"): the cascade culls walk only the full-frustum processes' objectArray, so right after the
	 * full-frustum cull every entry (reference root, or a terrain block's multibound node) whose content DCLF draws
	 * entirely is taken out of it (SunCandidates, SunExclusion). Those entries are then never traversed, culled or
	 * registered for the cascades. What the registration would have written, the sun's bits in each geometry's
	 * activeLightMask, DCLF writes when the main camera registers the geometry: the cascades its bound meets, tested
	 * against the planes the engine's own cascade cull used (the Geometric rule; CS_DCLF_SUN_EXCLUDE=probe compares
	 * them with the engine's bits, and the casters the exclusion would lose, on a dry run).
	 *
	 * The timing probe (TEMP, CS_DCLF_SUN_TIMING=1) measures the render thread in the full-frustum cull
	 * (FUN_141511f30), in Accumulate, and in the sun's registrations.
