	 * @brief What an epoch's build needs from the render thread's services, resolved ahead of the build.
	 *
	 * A build may not call the engine, D3D11, DXVK's interop, or ORG's services (descriptor allocation,
	 * pipeline lookups, uploads). Everything the epoch used to fetch from those as it went is resolved here
	 * by the render thread, where the services are available and the GPU is busy - the pipeline set indices
	 * and register usage at EarlyPrepass, the descriptor indices inside an epoch's own preparation - and
	 * read by the build as plain tables parallel to SceneStore's slot tables. Each entry keeps the key of the
	 * slot it was resolved for, so a swept and reused slot is never served a previous tenant's indices.
	 *
	 * A slot without an entry is not skipped silently: the build defers the draw with a reason, and the
	 * render thread resolves the entry at its next opportunity, so the draw lands a frame later (the same
	 * class of delay as a pipeline still compiling, and never a hole: the native loop is only told to
	 * withhold what DCLF has drawn).
	 *
	 * `generation` changes whenever an entry a build may have read changes its value (a descriptor evicted
	 * and re-imported, the pipeline set recreated, the tables reset); a payload built against an older
	 * generation is not committed.
