	/**
	 * @brief Captures each lighting pass as the engine registers it with a batch renderer.
	 *
	 * DCLF reads the passes the main camera will draw out of the accumulator's batch renderer
	 * (`SceneStore::CollectAccumulatedPasses`). That works only while the passes are in there, so it
	 * cannot survive static ownership, whose whole point is to keep them out. Capturing at registration
	 * gives the same information one step earlier, from the call that puts a pass into a group.
	 *
	 * `BSBatchRenderer::RegisterPass` (vfunc 0x02) is the right place rather than
	 * `BSLightingShaderProperty::GetRenderPasses`: the two fields DCLF depends on do not exist yet when
	 * `GetRenderPasses` returns. `technique` is the batch group's key, which the caller computes and
	 * passes in as `techniqueID` (it differs from the pass's own `passEnum` - the accumulator adds
	 * DoAlphaTest), and `subPass` is chosen inside registration.
	 *
	 * **Registration is threaded.** The engine's own classifier takes a mutex, and the scene lists are
	 * built on the `gJobList_SceneListAccumCulling` job list, so this is called concurrently. Entries go
	 * into a fixed-capacity buffer with an atomic cursor; the render thread drains it once per frame and
	 * is the only reader. Overflow is counted and makes the frame fall back to the accumulator walk.
