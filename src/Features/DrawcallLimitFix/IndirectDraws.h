	 * @brief Phase 2: DCLF's objects drawn by the render graph with one indirect command stream, into
	 * off-screen copies of the main pass's targets (the frame itself is unchanged).
	 *
	 * At the first lighting draw of the main (deferred) pass, CaptureMainPass records what the pass binds;
	 * before the deferred composite, Execute runs the graph's MainOpaque epoch. Inside it the draw data is assembled on the CPU and uploaded:
	 *   - constant blocks packed with the native shaders' constant tables: PerTechnique per pipeline,
	 *     PerMaterial per (material, pipeline), PerGeometry per object, Light Limit Fix's StrictLightData
	 *     per (room, shadow mask), the permutation per (pipeline, object flags), the alpha-test reference
	 *     per threshold, and every other bound constant buffer from its CPU mirror (ConstantMirror);
	 *   - one DrawBindings record per object (constant buffer addresses, texture and sampler heap indices);
	 *   - one DrawSequence per object.
	 * A graph pass then executes the sequences against the main depth buffer (imported from DXVK, read
	 * only, depth test EQUAL) into eight graph-owned targets with the main pass's formats. An object is
	 * drawn only when everything its pipeline's shaders read can be supplied.
	 *
	 * Render thread only.
