	/**
	 * @brief Where every value of a material record comes from, and when it changes (engine notes,
	 * "BSLightingShader::SetupMaterial: where every material constant comes from").
	 *
	 * A record is what SetupMaterial writes for one (material, pass descriptor). Its inputs are of four kinds,
	 * and each is kept current by its own deterministic rule rather than by noticing that a record went stale:
	 *
	 * - The material's own fields. They change only when something writes the material: a shader-property
	 *   controller (BSLightingShaderPropertyFloatController / ColorController::Update), or the material's
	 *   in-place rewrites (CopyMembers, OnLoadTextureSet, ClearTextures, ReceiveValuesFromRootMaterial; CS's
	 *   PBR materials report theirs through NoteWritten). Each write is an event; the accumulate phase
	 *   re-evaluates exactly the written materials.
	 * - TexcoordOffset (VS 11): the material's two texture-transform buffers, read at the index the engine
	 *   flips every frame (Main::Update). A controller writes the buffer the next frame reads. It is computed
	 *   from the material's fields for every used material every frame (ApplyTextureTransform).
	 * - The shader object and engine globals: IBLParams, PS 6, SnowRimLightParameters, CharacterLightParams,
	 *   LODTexParams.z, LandscapeTexture5to6IsSnow.zw. The same for every material that writes them, so they
	 *   are taken each frame from one live evaluation per signature (Signature, ApplyFrameComponents).
	 * - Render targets: the character light's t11, re-picked every frame; with the frame components.
