	 * into BasicRHI without ownership (dxvkGetInteropResourceInfo), and a view with the SRV's format,
	 * range and swizzle is written into a slot of ORG's shader-visible heap, read in the layout DXVK keeps
	 * the image in. The SRV stays referenced while cached; entries unused for kEvictFrames are released
	 * and their slots retire against ORG's queue fences.
	 *
	 * Samplers copy the renderer's own D3D11 sampler states (the table the engine selects from by the
	 * shadow state's address and filter modes) into ORG's sampler heap.
	 *
	 * Only while a graph epoch prepares (ORG's descriptor service is active); render thread.
