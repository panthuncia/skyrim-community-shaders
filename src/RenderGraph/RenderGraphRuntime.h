/**
 * @brief OpenRenderGraph running on DXVK's own Vulkan device.
 *
 * BasicRHI adopts the VkDevice and graphics queue DXVK created for the game's D3D11
 * device, so graph passes record native Vulkan work that shares memory and the
 * queue with the translated D3D11 stream. Synchronization is coarse: each epoch
 * flushes DXVK (everything recorded so far is submitted ahead of the graph), then
 * the graph submits on the same queue under DXVK's submission lock, with full
 * memory barriers at its entry and exit. Later D3D11 work is therefore ordered
 * after the graph without semaphores.
 *
 * Graph-owned outputs are handed to D3D11 as wrappers over the graph's own Vulkan
 * objects (WrapBuffer). Game resources the graph reads directly (Drawcall Limit Fix's
 * static geometry and textures) are described through DescribeResource, which marks
 * them stable in DXVK; nothing else the game or DXVK owns is pinned or relocated.
 *
 * Header deliberately free of ORG/BasicRHI/Vulkan includes: those require volk
 * ahead of any Vulkan header, which only the implementation files arrange.
